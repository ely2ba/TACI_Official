These could include reading circles, art projects, science experiments, or outdoor games.\n\n2. **Recruitment of Volunteers**\n   Send out notices to parents and older students inviting them to volunteer for these activities. Include a brief description of the activity and the role they will play.\n\n3. **Orientation and Training**\n   Once volunteers are recruited, conduct an orientation session. This will provide them with an understanding of the activity, their role, and how they can best support the children.\n\n4. **Scheduling**\n   Create a schedule that outlines when each volunteer will participate in the activities. This will ensure a consistent presence of volunteers and older students.\n\n5. **Execution**\n   Implement the activities as planned. Encourage the volunteers and older students to engage with the children, guiding them through the activity and facilitating complex play.\n\n6. **Feedback and Appreciation**\n   After the activity, gather feedback from the volunteers, older students, and children. This will help improve future activities. Also, show appreciation for the volunteers' and older students' time and effort.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
