Begin by assessing the student's current understanding of the topic. This can be done through a quick quiz or a one-on-one discussion.\n    1.2. Based on the assessment, tailor your instruction to meet the student's specific needs. This could involve re-teaching concepts, providing additional practice, or introducing new material.\n    1.3. Use a variety of teaching methods, such as direct instruction, guided practice, and independent practice. This will help to engage the student and cater to their preferred learning style.\n    1.4. Provide regular feedback to the student. This will help them to understand their progress and areas for improvement.\n\n2. **Group Instruction:**\n    2.1. Start by setting clear expectations for group work. This includes defining roles, setting goals, and establishing guidelines for respectful communication.\n    2.2. Use a variety of teaching methods, such as lectures, discussions, and demonstrations. This will help to engage all students and cater to different learning styles.\n    2.3. Facilitate group discussions by asking open-ended questions and encouraging all students to participate.\n    2.4. Monitor group work closely to ensure that all students are participating and understanding the material. Provide feedback and guidance as needed.\n    2.5. Conclude group activities with a debriefing session. This allows students to reflect on what they learned and how they worked together as a team.\n\n3. **Demonstrations:**\n    3.1. Plan your demonstration carefully. Make sure it is relevant to the topic and easy for students to understand.\n    3.2. Explain each step of the demonstration clearly and slowly. Use visual aids if necessary.\n    3.3. After the demonstration, ask students to explain what they saw in their own words. This will help to reinforce their understanding.\n    3.4. Provide opportunities for students to practice the demonstrated skill or concept. This could involve individual practice or group activities.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
