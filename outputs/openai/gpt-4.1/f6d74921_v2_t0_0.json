Assign parent volunteers and older students to each station to guide, model, and encourage deeper engagement.\n\n2. **Provide Training and Clear Roles**  \n   Offer a brief orientation for volunteers and older students, explaining the goals of focused, complex play and their role in facilitating\u2014not directing\u2014children\u2019s activities. Provide example questions and prompts to help scaffold children\u2019s thinking.\n\n3. **Pair and Rotate Helpers**  \n   Pair each group of children with a parent or older student. Rotate helpers between groups or stations so children benefit from diverse interactions and support.\n\n4. **Encourage Open-Ended Questions**  \n   Instruct volunteers to use open-ended questions (\u201cWhat do you think will happen if\u2026?\u201d or \u201cHow could you solve this problem?\u201d) to promote critical thinking and problem-solving during play.\n\n5. **Model and Extend Play**  \n   Encourage older students to model complex play behaviors, such as negotiating roles in pretend play or planning steps in a building project. Parent volunteers can help extend play by introducing new materials or challenges.\n\n6. **Reflect and Share**  \n   At the end of the activity, gather children, volunteers, and older students to share what they built, discovered, or learned. This reflection reinforces learning and values everyone\u2019s contributions.\n\n7. **Gather Feedback**  \n   Ask volunteers and older students for feedback on what worked well and what could be improved. Use their insights to refine future play sessions and increase engagement.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
