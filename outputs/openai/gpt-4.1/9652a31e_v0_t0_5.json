I would then review the purchase order, packing slip, and any relevant specifications to confirm the discrepancy. Next, I would contact the supplier or establishment representative via phone or email, providing clear information about the issue, including order numbers and evidence. I would work collaboratively to determine the best resolution, which could include returning goods, requesting replacements, or negotiating credits. All communications and outcomes would be recorded for future reference and audit purposes.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
