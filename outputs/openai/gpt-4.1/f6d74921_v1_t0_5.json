Here are a few strategies to facilitate this involvement:\n\n1. **Parent Volunteer Play Leaders:** Invite parents to participate as play leaders during designated play sessions. Provide them with guidelines and examples of complex play scenarios (e.g., building elaborate structures, role-playing, or organizing group games) so they can support and extend children\u2019s play without taking over.\n\n2. **Older Student Buddies:** Pair older students with younger children during playtime. Older buddies can help model positive social interactions, introduce new play ideas, and encourage teamwork. This mentorship fosters leadership skills in older students while supporting younger children\u2019s play.\n\n3. **Workshops and Training:** Offer brief orientation sessions for both parent volunteers and older students on the value of complex play, effective scaffolding techniques, and the importance of letting children lead their play.\n\n4. **Rotating Roles:** Establish a rotating schedule so different parents and older students have opportunities to participate, ensuring a diverse range of interactions and ideas.\n\nBy involving our school community in this way, we can provide richer, more supportive play experiences that promote creativity, problem-solving, and social development.\n\nThank you for your collaboration in making our learning environment vibrant and inclusive.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
