Key milestones include system selection (Q1), pilot implementation (Q2), full rollout (Q3), and performance review (Q4). Resource allocation, risk assessment, and stakeholder engagement strategies have been established to ensure timely execution.\n\n2. **Progress**  \n   - System selection was completed on schedule in Q1, with Vendor X chosen for their robust integration capabilities.  \n   - The pilot implementation began in early Q2 at two distribution centers. Initial training sessions for staff were conducted, and feedback mechanisms were established.  \n   - Early data indicates improved inventory visibility and a 10% reduction in stock discrepancies at pilot sites.  \n   - Full rollout preparations are underway, with procurement of necessary hardware and scheduling of additional training sessions.\n\n3. **Results**  \n   - The pilot phase demonstrated a 15% improvement in order fulfillment speed and a 12% reduction in logistics costs at participating centers.  \n   - Stakeholder feedback has been positive, particularly regarding real-time tracking and reporting features.  \n   - Lessons learned from the pilot are being incorporated into the full rollout plan to mitigate identified risks and enhance user adoption.\n\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
