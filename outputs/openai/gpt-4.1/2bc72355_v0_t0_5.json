Lectures: I present new material in a clear and organized way, using visuals and examples to help students understand key concepts.\n2. Discussions: I encourage students to share their ideas and ask questions, fostering a collaborative learning environment where everyone can participate.\n3. Demonstrations: I show students how to complete tasks or solve problems step-by-step, allowing them to observe before practicing on their own.\n4. Individual Instruction: I provide one-on-one support to students who need extra help, adapting my teaching to meet their unique learning needs.\n5. Group Activities: I organize students into small groups for projects or problem-solving tasks, helping them learn from each other and work as a team.\n\nBy combining these methods, I ensure that all students are engaged and able to learn in ways that suit their individual strengths.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
