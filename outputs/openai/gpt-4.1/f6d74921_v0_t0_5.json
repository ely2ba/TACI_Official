Provide them with guidance and training on how to scaffold children's play, ask open-ended questions, and encourage problem-solving. Assign specific roles, such as leading a small group, setting up materials, or modeling cooperative play. Rotate responsibilities so everyone has a chance to engage with different children and activities. Encourage reflection and feedback after sessions to continuously improve the experience and ensure it remains meaningful and developmentally appropriate for all participants.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
