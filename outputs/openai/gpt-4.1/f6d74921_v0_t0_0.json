Assign specific roles to parents and older students, such as leading small group games, assisting with building projects, or guiding creative activities like art or science experiments. Provide clear instructions and training so they understand how to encourage problem-solving, cooperation, and imaginative thinking without taking over the play. Rotate volunteers to ensure all children benefit from diverse interactions, and gather feedback to improve the experience. This approach not only enriches play but also builds a supportive classroom community.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
