Identify the Legal Issue: Clearly define the legal question or issue you are researching.\n\n2. Gather Primary Sources:\n   - Statutes: Use official government websites or legal databases (e.g., Westlaw, LexisNexis) to find relevant federal, state, or local statutes.\n   - Case Law (Decisions): Search for judicial opinions from courts that have addressed similar issues. Use citation tools and headnotes to find leading cases.\n   - Codes: Locate applicable codes (e.g., U.S. Code, state codes) that govern the subject matter.\n\n3. Gather Secondary Sources:\n   - Legal Articles: Search law reviews, legal journals, and reputable online publications for scholarly analysis and commentary.\n   - Treatises and Practice Guides: Use these for in-depth explanations and practical guidance.\n\n4. Analyze the Data:\n   - Read and summarize the key points of each source.\n   - Note how statutes and cases have been interpreted and applied.\n   - Identify any conflicts or trends in the law.\n\n5. Synthesize Findings:\n   - Compare and contrast the authorities.\n   - Determine how the law applies to your specific issue.\n   - Prepare a memorandum or report summarizing your research, including citations.\n\n6. Update Research:\n   - Use citators (e.g., Shepard\u2019s, KeyCite) to ensure your authorities are still good law and have not been overruled or amended.\n\nIf you provide a specific legal issue or jurisdiction, I can tailor the research process and provide more targeted sources and analysis.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
