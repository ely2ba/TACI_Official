You can prepare summaries of your findings for attorneys and help coordinate the resolution of any title issues prior to closing. While you cannot arbitrate disputes yourself (as this is typically reserved for licensed attorneys or certified arbitrators), you can facilitate communication between parties, gather relevant documentation, and assist attorneys in preparing for dispute resolution or arbitration proceedings related to real estate transactions.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
