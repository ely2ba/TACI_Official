Draft the affidavit by clearly stating the facts in a chronological and logical order, ensuring accuracy and completeness. Include the affiant's personal details and a statement of truth. Review the draft for clarity and legal compliance, then have the affiant sign the document in the presence of a notary public.\n\nFor legal correspondence, identify the purpose and audience of the communication. Use a formal tone and structure, starting with a clear subject line and introduction. Present the information concisely, addressing all relevant points, and conclude with any required actions or responses. Proofread for errors and ensure adherence to any specific formatting guidelines.\n\nOrganize and maintain documents by categorizing them into a logical filing system, whether paper or electronic. Use clear labels and consistent naming conventions for easy retrieval. Regularly update the system to reflect new documents and changes, and ensure compliance with any legal or organizational record-keeping requirements.</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
