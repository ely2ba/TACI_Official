However, I must clarify that my role does not extend to arbitrating disputes between parties. Arbitration would require a neutral third party, typically a professional arbitrator or legal counsel, to oversee and resolve the conflict. My responsibilities are centered around supporting the legal aspects of real estate transactions under the supervision of an attorney.</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
