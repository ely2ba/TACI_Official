          "content": "<OUTPUT_TEXT>As part of the estate planning process, it is crucial to appraise and inventory all real and personal property. This ensures accurate valuation and assists in effective estate distribution. The appraisal process involves assessing the current market value of real estate properties, including residential, commercial, and any land holdings. Personal property, including vehicles, jewelry, artwork, and other valuables, should also be evaluated by qualified appraisers to determine their fair market value. \n\nAn inventory list should be created, detailing each item's description, location, and estimated value. This list will be essential for both planning the estate and for eventual estate administration. It is advisable to keep this inventory updated regularly to reflect any significant changes or additions to the property. \n\nDocumentation such as property deeds, recent tax assessments, and receipts or certificates of authenticity for personal items should be gathered to support the valuation claims. This comprehensive approach ensures the estate is accurately represented and facilitates the smooth execution of estate plans.</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
