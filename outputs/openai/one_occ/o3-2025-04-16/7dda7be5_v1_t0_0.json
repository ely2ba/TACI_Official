Coordinate with CPA on potential alternate valuation date election (IRC \u00a72032) if market volatility continues.  \n4. Prepare personal property receipt/acknowledgment forms for heirs to sign upon distribution (helps reduce post-distribution disputes).  \n5. Review and update homeowners, auto, and umbrella insurance coverage to reflect current valuations until estate is settled.  \n6.
