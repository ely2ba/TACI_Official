Role: Act as a neutral facilitator, not legal counsel, unless licensed.  \n   b. Confidentiality: Comply with applicable arbitration rules and privacy laws (e.g., Gramm-Leach-Bliley).  \n   c. Impartiality: Disclose potential conflicts of interest in writing.  \n\n2. Initial File Intake  \n   a. Collect executed purchase agreement, addenda, and any arbitration/ADR provisions.  \n   b. Obtain complete title commitment, prior deeds, surveys, and payoff statements.  \n   c. Create a chronology of key dates (inspection deadlines, financing contingencies, closing date).  \n\n3. Dispute Arbitration Workflow  \n   3.1 Identify the Dispute  \n       \u2022 Typical issues: earnest-money release, title defects, property condition, boundary discrepancies.  \n   3.2 Confirm ADR Clause  \n       \u2022 Verify venue, governing rules (AAA, JAMS, or state-specific), and time limits.  \n   3.3 Select Neutral Arbitrator  \n       \u2022 Provide parties a roster, collect ranked preferences, issue formal appointment letter.  \n   3.4 Exchange of Evidence (Discovery)  \n       \u2022 Schedule disclosure deadlines; use secure portal for documents.  \n   3.5 Hearing Procedure  \n       \u2022 Opening statements \u2192 witness testimony \u2192 document presentation \u2192 closing arguments.  \n   3.6 Drafting the Award  \n       \u2022 Include findings of fact, conclusions of law, monetary or equitable relief, and deadline for performance.  \n   3.7 Enforcement  \n       \u2022 File award with court if confirmation is needed; monitor compliance milestones.  \n\n4. Title Search Review Checklist  \n   a. Verify legal description matches contract & survey.  \n   b. Chain of Title: Ensure continuous, unbroken ownership for statutory period.  \n   c. Liens & Encumbrances: Mortgages, tax liens, HOA liens, UCC filings.  \n   d. Easements & Rights-of-Way: Note location, beneficiaries, and impact on use/value.  \n   e. Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions (CC&Rs): Identify limitations on construction or occupancy.  \n   f. Judgment Search: Federal, state, and municipal levels.  \n   g. Real-Estate Taxes: Confirm status, exemptions, and prorations.  \n   h. Gap Coverage: Verify search period extends to anticipated recording date.  \n\n5. Title Curative Actions  \n   \u2022 Obtain lien releases or satisfactions.  \n   \u2022 File corrective or quitclaim deeds to resolve defects in prior conveyances.  \n   \u2022 Secure subordination agreements for junior liens.  \n   \u2022 Pursue quiet-title action if adverse claims cannot be otherwise cleared.  \n   \u2022 Request specific title insurance endorsements (e.g., survey, restrictive-covenant).  \n\n6. Closing Preparation  \n   6.1 Settlement Statement (HUD-1 or Closing Disclosure)  \n       \u2022 Cross-check prorations, credits, escrow deposits, and commissions.  \n   6.2 Funding Logistics  \n       \u2022 Confirm wire instructions verbally with originating bank; obtain good-funds verification.  \n   6.3 Execution & Notarization  \n       \u2022 Prepare signing package; ensure IDs meet state notary requirements; collect witness signatures where required.  \n   6.4 Recording  \n       \u2022 Pre-submit documents for county review if e-recording available; verify recording fees.  \n\n7. Post-Closing Follow-Up  \n   a. Confirm recording book/page or instrument number.  \n   b. Issue final title policy to buyer and lender.  \n   c. Reconcile escrow file; disburse remaining balances.  \n   d. Provide parties with final executed documents and closing package.  \n\n8. Common Pitfalls & Mitigation Tips  \n   \u2022 Missed liens from name variations \u2192 run wildcard and sound-alike searches.  \n   \u2022 Last-minute lender conditions \u2192 obtain conditional approval before scheduling signing.  \n   \u2022 Wire fraud \u2192 use multi-factor verification for any change in instructions.  \n   \u2022 Expired corporate authority \u2192 confirm entity good-standing certificates within 30 days of closing.  \n\n9.
