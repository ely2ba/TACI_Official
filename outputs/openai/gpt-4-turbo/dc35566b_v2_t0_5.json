Typically, this can be numerical (Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2, etc.) or alphabetical (Exhibit A, Exhibit B, etc.).\n   - Ensure labels are clear and consistent across all documentation and communications.\n\n3. **Creating an Exhibit List**\n   - Compile a detailed list of all exhibits, including their label, a brief description, and the relevance to the case.\n   - Make multiple copies of the exhibit list for the court, opposing counsel, and for your own team\u2019s reference during the trial.\n\n4. **Preparing Exhibit Binders**\n   - Organize exhibits into binders or digital folders, depending on the format of the trial (physical court setting or virtual).\n   - Use tabs and dividers for easy access and reference. Each section should correlate with the exhibit list for seamless navigation.\n\n5. **Reviewing and Updating**\n   - Regularly review the exhibits with the attorney to ensure all items are pertinent and properly documented.\n   - Update the exhibit list and binders as new items are added or if there are changes in the strategy that affect the relevance of certain exhibits.\n\n6. **Final Check and Coordination**\n   - Perform a final check to ensure all exhibits are in order and properly labeled.\n   - Coordinate with the legal team to confirm that everyone has the latest copies of the exhibit list and understands the layout of the exhibit binders.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
