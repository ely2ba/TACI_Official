It includes the total of products or services provided minus any payments already made.\n\n2. **Interest Charges**: Interest can be calculated using the formula: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time. This is the cost incurred by borrowing money, and it is usually expressed as a percentage of the principal.\n\n3. **Balances**: This refers to the amount of money in an account at any given time. It is calculated by subtracting the total debits from the total credits in the account.\n\n4. **Discounts**: Discounts are reductions granted on the original price of goods or services. They can be calculated as a percentage of the original price or as a fixed amount.\n\n5. **Equity**: Equity represents ownership value in an asset or business, calculated as Total Assets minus Total Liabilities. It reflects the residual asset value owned by shareholders after all liabilities are settled.\n\n6. **Principal**: This is the original sum of money borrowed in a loan or the initial amount of money invested, not including any interest or earnings.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
