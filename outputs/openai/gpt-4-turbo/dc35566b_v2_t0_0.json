Ensure that each item is accounted for and has been disclosed to the opposing counsel as per discovery rules.\n\n2. **Label Each Exhibit**\n   - Assign a unique identifier to each exhibit (e.g., Exhibit A, Exhibit B, etc.). Label them clearly and consistently to avoid any confusion during the trial.\n\n3. **Prepare Exhibit List**\n   - Create a comprehensive list of all exhibits in the order they will likely be introduced at trial. Include a brief description and the corresponding label for each exhibit.\n\n4. **Organize Exhibits Logically**\n   - Arrange the exhibits in a logical order that aligns with the sequence of the trial presentation. Group related exhibits together to facilitate easy access and presentation.\n\n5. **Create Digital Copies**\n   - Ensure that all physical exhibits have digital counterparts, if possible. Store these digital versions in a secure and easily accessible digital format.\n\n6. **Prepare Binders or Folders**\n   - Use binders or folders to organize the exhibits physically. Each binder or folder should be clearly marked with the exhibit labels and contain all related documents.\n\n7. **Review with Legal Team**\n   - Go over the organized exhibits with attorneys and other team members. Confirm that every exhibit is in its proper place and that there are no missing items.\n\n8. **Prepare for Presentation**\n   - Plan how each exhibit will be presented in court. This might involve setting up electronic displays or preparing physical items for easy viewing by the court.\n\n9. **Backup Plan**\n   - Have backups for all exhibits, especially critical ones. Prepare for potential technical issues with digital exhibits by having physical copies available.\n\n10. **Final Check**\n    - Conduct a final review of all exhibits and their organization the day before the trial to ensure everything is in order and ready for a smooth presentation.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
