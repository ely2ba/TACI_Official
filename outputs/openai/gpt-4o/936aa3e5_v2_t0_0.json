For example, if you have three invoices of $100, $200, and $300, the total amount due is $600.\n\n2. **Interest Charges**  \n   Interest charges can be calculated using the formula:  \n   \\[ \\text{Interest} = \\text{Principal} \\times \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Time} \\]  \n   For example, if the principal is $1,000, the annual interest rate is 5%, and the time is 1 year, the interest charge is $50.\n\n3. **Balances**  \n   The balance is the amount remaining in an account after all transactions have been accounted for. For example, if you start with $1,000 and spend $300, the balance is $700.\n\n4. **Discounts**  \n   Discounts can be calculated by multiplying the original price by the discount rate. For example, if an item costs $100 and there is a 10% discount, the discount amount is $10, making the final price $90.\n\n5. **Equity**  \n   Equity is calculated as the difference between total assets and total liabilities. For example, if a company has assets of $500,000 and liabilities of $300,000, the equity is $200,000.\n\n6. **Principal**  \n   The principal is the initial amount of money borrowed or invested, excluding any interest or earnings. For example, if you take out a loan of $5,000, the principal is $5,000.\n\n<OUTPUT_TEXT>\n1. Amounts Due: $600\n2. Interest Charges: $50\n3. Balances: $700\n4. Discounts: $10 (Final Price: $90)\n5. Equity: $200,000\n6. Principal: $5,000\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
