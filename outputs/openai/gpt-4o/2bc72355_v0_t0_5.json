For lectures, prepare clear and concise presentations with visual aids to help students grasp complex concepts. During discussions, encourage students to share their thoughts and ask questions to foster a collaborative learning environment. Demonstrations can be particularly effective for hands-on subjects, allowing students to see practical applications of what they are learning. Tailor your approach to the needs of your students, ensuring that each student receives the support they need to succeed.</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
