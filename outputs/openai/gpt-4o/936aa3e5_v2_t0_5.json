For example, if there are three invoices with amounts of $100, $200, and $150, the total amount due is $450.\n\n2. **Interest Charges**  \n   To calculate interest charges, use the formula:  \n   Interest = Principal x Rate x Time  \n   For example, for a principal of $1,000 at an annual interest rate of 5% over 1 year:  \n   Interest = $1,000 x 0.05 x 1 = $50\n\n3. **Balances**  \n   To determine a balance, subtract total expenses from total income. For example, if total income is $5,000 and total expenses are $3,000, the balance is $2,000.\n\n4. **Discounts**  \n   To calculate a discount, multiply the original price by the discount rate. For example, for a $200 item with a 10% discount:  \n   Discount = $200 x 0.10 = $20  \n   Discounted Price = $200 - $20 = $180\n\n5. **Equity**  \n   Equity is calculated as Assets minus Liabilities. For example, if a company has assets of $50,000 and liabilities of $20,000, the equity is $30,000.\n\n6. **Principal**  \n   The principal is the initial amount of a loan or investment. If you borrow $5,000, that amount is the principal.\n\n<OUTPUT_TEXT>\n1. Amounts Due: $450\n2. Interest Charges: $50\n3. Balances: $2,000\n4. Discounts: $20 (Discounted Price: $180)\n5. Equity: $30,000\n6. Principal: $5,000\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
