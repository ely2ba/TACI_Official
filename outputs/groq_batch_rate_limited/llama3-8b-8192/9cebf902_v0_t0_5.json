I would utilize online legal databases, such as Westlaw or LexisNexis, to access a vast repository of legal information. I would also review relevant codes, documents, and other materials to identify key points and trends. Additionally, I would analyze the data to identify areas of conflict, inconsistencies, and potential legal issues, and summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner."
