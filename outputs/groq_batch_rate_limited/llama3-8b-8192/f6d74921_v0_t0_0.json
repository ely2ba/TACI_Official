This could include activities such as building complex structures with blocks, creating intricate art projects, or engaging in role-playing scenarios. The parent volunteers and older students can provide guidance and support while allowing the younger students to take the lead and make decisions. This not only encourages socialization and teamwork but also helps to develop problem-solving skills and creativity. Additionally, I would provide training and guidance to the parent volunteers and older students on how to facilitate the activities and ensure that they are aligned with the curriculum and learning objectives."
