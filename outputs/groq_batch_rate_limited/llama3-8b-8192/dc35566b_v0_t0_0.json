This would involve creating a detailed inventory of each exhibit, including its description, relevance to the case, and any necessary authentication or certification. I would also ensure that all exhibits are properly labeled and stored in a secure location to prevent loss or tampering. Additionally, I would review the exhibits with the attorney to ensure that they are relevant to the case and to identify any potential issues or concerns."
