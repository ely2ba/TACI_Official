For example, if the total amount owed is $1,000 and the amount paid is $500, the amount due would be:\n\n$1,000 - $500 = $500\n\n<h2>Interest Charges</h2>\nTo calculate the interest charge, we need to multiply the outstanding balance by the interest rate. For example, if the outstanding balance is $500 and the interest rate is 10%, the interest charge would be:\n\n$500 x 0.10 = $50\n\n<h2>Balance</h2>\nTo calculate the balance, we need to add the amount paid to the outstanding balance. For example, if the outstanding balance is $500 and the amount paid is $200, the new balance would be:\n\n$500 + $200 = $700\n\n<h2>Discounts</h2>\nTo calculate the discount, we need to subtract the discount amount from the total amount owed. For example, if the total amount owed is $1,000 and the discount amount is 5%, the discount would be:\n\n$1,000 x 0.05 = $50\n\n<h2>Equity</h2>\nTo calculate the equity, we need to subtract the liabilities from the assets. For example, if the assets are $10,000 and the liabilities are $5,000, the equity would be:\n\n$10,000 - $5,000 = $5,000\n\n<h2>Principal</h2>\nTo calculate the principal, we need to subtract the interest from the total amount paid. For example, if the total amount paid is $1,000 and the interest is $50, the principal would be:\n\n$1,000 - $50 = $950\n\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
