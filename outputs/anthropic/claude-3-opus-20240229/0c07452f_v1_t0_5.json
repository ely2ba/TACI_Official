As educators, it is our responsibility to:\n\n• Review the student handbook and be thoroughly familiar with all school policies and rules\n• Clearly communicate behavior expectations to students at the beginning of the year and remind them regularly\n• Supervise students at all times and immediately address any misbehavior or rule violations\n• Follow the progressive discipline procedures outlined in the handbook for repeat offenses or serious infractions\n• Treat all students fairly and equitably when enforcing rules; avoid showing favoritism or inconsistency\n• Document and report significant behavior issues to administrators and parents in a timely manner\n• Model appropriate conduct and respect for the rules through your own behavior as an educator\n\nBy holding students accountable and uniformly enforcing school policies, we maintain a positive learning environment, keep students safe, and help them develop into responsible citizens. If you have any questions about the rules or need guidance handling a discipline issue, please see me or an administrator.\nThank you for your diligence and cooperation in this crucial aspect of our duties as educators.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
