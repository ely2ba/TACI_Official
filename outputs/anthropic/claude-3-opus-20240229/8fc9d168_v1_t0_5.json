Frequent and open communication will help ensure we remain aligned.\n\n• Designate points of contact on both of our teams to serve as dedicated relationship managers. They will take the lead on coordinating joint efforts and facilitating the flow of information between our organizations.\n\n• Host periodic business reviews to discuss our partnership at a strategic level, review performance metrics, and set goals for the future. This will provide a forum to strengthen our relationship and drive continuous improvement.\n\n• Look for opportunities to collaborate on initiatives outside of our typical logistics work, such as sustainability efforts or community outreach. Partnering in other areas will help build trust and rapport between our teams.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like to discuss any of these ideas further. I look forward to working together to accomplish great things.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
