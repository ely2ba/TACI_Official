Create a summary document or presentation highlighting the key features, benefits, and use cases of any new or updated BI tools, reports, or metadata improvements. Use clear language geared toward your target audience.\n\n2. Host a webinar or in-person training session to walk through the new capabilities, demonstrate how to use them, and answer any questions. Record the session for those unable to attend live.\n\n3. Send an announcement email to relevant stakeholders and users with a brief overview of what's new, why it's important, and links to the summary document and training recording for more details. \n\n4. Update any existing user guides, wikis, or knowledge bases with information on the enhancements. Include screenshots and step-by-step instructions where appropriate.\n\n5. Identify power users or champions within different departments who can help evangelize the updates and serve as resources for their teams. Brief them in advance and provide them with any materials they need.\n\n6. Add a section on the new features to any regularly scheduled BI team newsletters, status reports, or other communications to keep the information top of mind.\n\n7. For major updates, consider holding office hours or setting up a temporary help desk where users can get their questions answered and issues resolved quickly by the experts on your team.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
