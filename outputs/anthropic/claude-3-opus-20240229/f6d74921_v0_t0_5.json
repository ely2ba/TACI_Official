They can help guide the play while letting the children take the lead.\n\n- Ask volunteers to teach children more advanced skills like woodworking, sewing, or robotics, with an emphasis on open-ended projects that foster creativity. \n\n- Organize a volunteer-led \"Maker Space\" with various building materials and tools where children can work on self-directed engineering and art projects.\n\n- Have volunteers supervise and facilitate a dramatic play area, helping provide props and costumes while encouraging the children to develop and act out complex storylines.\n\n- Match up volunteers with children who share a common interest, like music, chess, or coding, and provide time for them to explore the topic in depth together through lessons and self-directed projects.\n\nThe key is for the volunteers to enable more sophisticated, extended play by providing tools, instruction, and guidance, while still allowing the children to be creative and self-directed as much as possible. The social interaction with volunteers can also enrich the play experience.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
