Here are the key points of the program:\n\n- Parent volunteers will be recruited and trained to help lead small group activities with students during class time. This will allow for more individualized attention and guidance as children engage in educational games, art projects, science experiments, and other complex play.\n\n- We will partner with the middle school and high school to have responsible older students earn community service hours by volunteering in our elementary classrooms. The older students will be positive role models and can help the younger children tackle more challenging activities.\n\n- Teachers will plan specific activities for the volunteers to assist with that encourage creativity, critical thinking, and extended periods of focused play. Volunteers will be given clear instructions and goals for each activity.\n\n- Volunteers will work with the teacher's guidance to support and encourage the children as they explore, create, problem-solve, and collaborate during playtime. They will help create an enriching environment to get students deeply engaged.\n\nThe involvement of parent volunteers and older student role models in our classroom activities will enhance our ability to provide the kind of complex, absorbing play that is so vital for our elementary students' development and learning. We look forward to implementing this program to offer an improved classroom experience.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
