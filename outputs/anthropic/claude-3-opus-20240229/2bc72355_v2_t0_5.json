Lectures\nPrepare engaging lectures on the topic, breaking down key concepts. Speak clearly and use visual aids like slides or the whiteboard to reinforce main points. Pause frequently to ask questions and check for student understanding.\n\n2. Class Discussions  \nPose open-ended questions to the class to spark discussion and critical thinking. Encourage all students to participate by calling on quieter students. Guide the discussion, correcting misconceptions and highlighting insightful comments. Wrap up by summarizing key takeaways.\n\n3. Small Group Work\nDivide the class into small groups of 3-4 students. Assign a task or discussion topic for groups to collaborate on. Circulate between groups to listen in, ask probing questions, and offer guidance as needed. Have groups share their work with the class afterwards.\n\n4. Demonstrations and Modeling\nFor procedural or hands-on topics, provide step-by-step demonstrations. Explain each step, modeling proper techniques. Pause to let students ask questions. Then have students practice the skill themselves as you observe and provide feedback.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
