Determine the relevant jurisdiction and sources of law that apply (statutes, case law, regulations, etc.).\n\n2. Conduct searches of online legal databases such as Westlaw, LexisNexis, Bloomberg Law, or free sources like Google Scholar to find relevant statutes, court decisions, law review articles, and other secondary sources. Use boolean operators and search filters to narrow results.\n\n3. Review the full text of promising search results to determine which sources are most relevant and authoritative. Take notes and record citations. Look for key language in statutes and holdings in cases that address the issue directly.\n\n4. Analyze the relevant sources to synthesize rules and principles of law. Note any splits of authority or contradictory holdings between cases or jurisdictions. Determine the prevailing view and weight of authority on the issue.\n\n5. Draft a research memorandum or brief summarizing the applicable law and how it likely applies to the facts and issues in question. Cite all sources and explain legal reasoning clearly. Have other team members review the analysis for accuracy and clarity.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
