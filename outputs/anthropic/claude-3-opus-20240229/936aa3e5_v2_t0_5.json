Amounts Due\nTo calculate an amount due, add up all relevant charges, fees, and taxes, then subtract any credits, discounts, or payments already made. The remaining balance is the amount due.\n\n2. Interest Charges \nInterest is calculated by multiplying the principal balance by the interest rate for a given time period. For example, if the principal is $1,000 at a 12% annual interest rate, the yearly interest charge would be: $1,000 x 12% = $120.\n\n3. Balances\nAn account balance is determined by taking the opening balance, adding any credits or deposits, and subtracting any debits, withdrawals, fees, or interest charges. The final amount is the closing balance for that period.\n\n4. Discounts\nA discount amount is calculated by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage. For example, a $50 item at a 20% discount would be: $50 x 20% = $10 discount. The discounted price is then $50 - $10 = $40.\n\n5. Equity\nEquity is the difference between the value of an asset and any liabilities against it. It's calculated as: Equity = Assets - Liabilities. For example, if a house is worth $250,000 and has a $150,000 mortgage balance, the equity would be $250,000 - $150,000 = $100,000.\n\n6. Principal \nPrincipal refers to the original sum of money borrowed in a loan, separate from interest charges. To calculate the principal portion of a loan payment, subtract the interest charges from the total payment amount. The remainder goes toward principal. For example, if a $500 monthly payment includes $80 of interest, the principal portion is $500 - $80 = $420.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
