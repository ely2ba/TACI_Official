Created a master exhibit list in Excel with columns for exhibit number, description, date, and notes\n2. Assigned unique exhibit numbers to all potential trial exhibits\n3. Organized physical copies of exhibits in numbered binders with tabs\n4. Scanned all exhibits and saved electronic copies in a dedicated trial folder on our secure server\n5. Prepared exhibit stickers with pre-printed numbers to affix to original documents\n6. Cross-referenced exhibits with key witness testimony and important case documents\n7. Flagged any sensitive or confidential exhibits that may require special handling\n8. Compiled copies of all exhibits for opposing counsel as part of our pretrial exchange\n9. Created a separate list of demonstrative exhibits, including charts, timelines, and diagrams\n10. Confirmed that all exhibits are properly authenticated and contain no privileged information\n\nPlease review the master exhibit list and let me know if you need any additional information or assistance in preparing the exhibits for trial. I will continue to update the list as we finalize our exhibit selections.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
