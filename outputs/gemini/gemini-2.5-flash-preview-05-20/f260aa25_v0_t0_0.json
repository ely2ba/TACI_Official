              "text": "<OUTPUT_TEXT>\nSubject: BI Update: New Sales Performance Dashboard & Enhanced Metric Definitions\n\nDear Team,\n\nWe are pleased to announce two significant enhancements to our Business Intelligence landscape, designed to empower your data-driven decisions:\n\n1.  **New Sales Performance Dashboard (SPD)**:\n    *   **What's New**: We have launched a comprehensive Sales Performance Dashboard, providing a consolidated view of key sales metrics including YTD revenue, pipeline health, regional performance, and sales cycle efficiency. This dashboard integrates data from our CRM and ERP systems, offering a single source of truth for sales insights.\n    *   **Benefit**: The SPD enables sales leaders and teams to quickly identify trends, monitor progress against targets, and pinpoint areas for strategic focus, ultimately driving more effective sales strategies.\n    *   **Access**: You can access the new Sales Performance Dashboard via our BI Portal under the 'Sales & Marketing' section, or directly at [Link to Dashboard].\n\n2.  **Enhanced Metadata for Core Business Metrics**:\n    *   **What's New**: We have completed a significant update to our metadata repository, focusing on improving the clarity and consistency of definitions for our core business metrics (e.g., 'Customer Lifetime Value', 'Churn Rate', 'Gross Margin'). Each metric now includes a standardized definition, calculation logic, and data source lineage.\n    *   **Benefit**: This enhancement ensures greater data literacy across the organization, reduces ambiguity, and promotes consistent interpretation and use of critical business data in all reports and analyses.\n    *   **Access**: The updated metadata definitions are now available in our Data Catalog at [Link to Data Catalog/Metadata Repository].\n\nWe encourage you to explore these new resources. For any questions, feedback, or support, please contact the BI Support Team at [BI Support Email/Channel].\n\nBest regards,\n\nThe Business Intelligence Team\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
