              "text": "<OUTPUT_TEXT>\nAs an expert Elementary School Teacher, my approach to enforcing administration policies and rules governing students is comprehensive and proactive, focusing on fostering a positive and productive learning environment:\n\n1.  **Explicit Instruction & Modeling:** I begin by clearly teaching, modeling, and regularly reviewing all school-wide and classroom-specific rules and expectations. We discuss *why* these rules are essential for safety, respect, and learning, ensuring students understand their purpose. I use age-appropriate language, visual aids, and positive framing.\n2.  **Consistent & Equitable Application:** I apply all policies and rules fairly and consistently to every student, ensuring predictability and equity in the classroom. Students understand that expectations are universal and reliable.\n3.  **Positive Behavior Reinforcement:** I proactively acknowledge and celebrate students who consistently adhere to rules and demonstrate positive behavior through verbal praise, classroom incentives, and positive communication with families. This reinforces desired conduct and builds a positive school culture.\n4.  **Age-Appropriate Consequences & Redirection:** When rules are broken, I implement logical, age-appropriate consequences focused on teaching responsibility, problem-solving, and making amends, rather than solely punishment. I utilize non-verbal cues, proximity control, and gentle redirection to guide students back to expected behavior whenever possible.\n5.  **Collaborative Communication:** For significant or recurring policy violations, I maintain clear, objective, and timely communication with parents, seeking partnership in addressing the behavior. I collaborate closely with school administration, counselors, and other support staff to ensure consistent school-wide enforcement and provide holistic support for students.\n6.  **Objective Documentation:** I maintain accurate and objective records of behavioral incidents and interventions, adhering to school policy, which informs ongoing support strategies, communication with stakeholders, and administrative actions when necessary.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
