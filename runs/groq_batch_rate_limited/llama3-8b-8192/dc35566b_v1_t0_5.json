This list would be organized alphabetically and include the exhibit number, description, and the witness who will be presenting the exhibit. I would also ensure that all exhibits are properly labeled and stored in a secure location to prevent loss or tampering. Additionally, I would prepare exhibit charts or diagrams to help illustrate complex evidence and make it easier for the jury to understand. Finally, I would verify that all exhibits are properly authenticated and meet the requirements of the court's rules of evidence.</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
