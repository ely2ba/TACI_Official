I will then ask the caller to state their name and the purpose of their call. Based on the caller's response, I will direct the call to the appropriate staff member, such as a doctor, nurse, or other medical professional. If the caller is a patient, I will ask for their medical record number or other relevant information to ensure accurate routing of the call. I will also take a message if the staff member is unavailable to take the call, and ensure that the message is delivered to the correct person in a timely manner.</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
