If a business borrows $1,000 at an interest rate of 10% per year, the interest charge for one year would be $100. If a company has assets worth $50,000 and liabilities worth $20,000, its equity would be $30,000. If a customer is offered a 5% discount on a $100 purchase, the discounted amount would be $95."
