I would then organize these exhibits in a logical and easily accessible manner, such as by category or chronologically. This would involve creating a detailed index or catalog of the exhibits, including descriptions, dates, and other relevant information. I would also ensure that all exhibits are properly labeled and stored in a secure and controlled environment to prevent loss or tampering. Additionally, I would prepare a plan for presenting the exhibits during trial, including determining the order in which they will be presented and identifying any necessary authentication or foundation for their admission into evidence.</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
