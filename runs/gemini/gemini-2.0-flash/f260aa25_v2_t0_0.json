This upgrade includes performance improvements, enhanced data connectivity options (including a new connector for Snowflake), and improved collaboration features. Please clear your browser cache after the upgrade to ensure optimal performance.\n\n2.  **New Sales Performance Dashboard:** A new interactive dashboard focusing on sales performance metrics is now available. This dashboard provides insights into sales by region, product, and sales representative. Key metrics include sales revenue, deal size, and conversion rates. Access it via the \"Sales\" folder in Tableau.\n\n3.  **Metadata Enhancements - Customer Dimension:** The \"Customer\" dimension in our data warehouse has been enriched with additional attributes, including customer segment, industry, and lifetime value. These new attributes are now available for use in your reports and analyses. Please review the updated data dictionary for detailed definitions.\n\n4.  **Power BI Report Server Migration:** We are migrating all Power BI reports to the new Power BI Report Server infrastructure. This migration will improve report performance and scalability. The migration is scheduled to be completed by the end of next week. During the migration, some reports may be temporarily unavailable. We will send out a separate communication with a detailed schedule.\n\n5.  **Data Governance Policy Update:** The data governance policy has been updated to reflect new regulations regarding data privacy. Please review the updated policy document, available on the company intranet, to ensure compliance.\n\n6.  **Training Resources:** Updated training materials for Tableau and Power BI are now available on the internal training portal.
