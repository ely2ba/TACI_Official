I will then direct the calls to the appropriate staff member or department based on the caller's request and established office protocols. If the intended recipient is unavailable, I will take a detailed message, including the caller's name, phone number, the reason for their call, and the date and time of the call. I will then deliver the message to the intended recipient promptly via the agreed-upon method (e.g., email, phone call, message slip). If I am unsure of where to direct a call, I will ask clarifying questions to determine the appropriate destination or consult with a supervisor.</OUTPUT_TEXT>\n"
