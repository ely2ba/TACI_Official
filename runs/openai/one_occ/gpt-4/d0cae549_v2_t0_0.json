This could include the plaintiff, defendant, or any third parties who have knowledge about the incident.\n\n2. Contact Witnesses\n   - Reach out to potential witnesses to discuss their availability and willingness to testify. This can be done through phone calls, emails, or in-person meetings.\n\n3. Prepare Subpoenas\n   - If a witness is unwilling to testify voluntarily, a subpoena may be necessary. This is a legal document that requires the witness to appear in court.\n\n4. Serve Subpoenas\n   - The subpoena must be served to the witness, typically by a process server. This ensures that the witness is legally obligated to appear in court.\n\n5. Confirm Attendance\n   - Follow up with witnesses to confirm their attendance at the hearing. This can help avoid any last-minute issues or misunderstandings.\n\n6. Prepare Witnesses\n   - Meet with witnesses before the hearing to go over their testimony. This can help them feel more comfortable and prepared when they are called to testify.\n\n7. Call Witnesses to Testify\n   - During the hearing, call upon each witness to testify in the order determined by the legal team. This will typically start with the plaintiff's witnesses, followed by the defendant's witnesses.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
