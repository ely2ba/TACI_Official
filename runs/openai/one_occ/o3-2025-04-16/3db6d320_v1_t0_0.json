Purpose  \nThis memorandum outlines a systematic approach to (1) gathering facts, (2) identifying potential causes of action, and (3) organizing preliminary case materials. It is drafted as a reusable model for matters in which key facts are not yet fully developed. Please note this memorandum provides general legal information for internal case-development purposes; it is not legal advice to any client.\n\nII. Factual Investigation Plan  \nA. Client & Witness Interviews  \n   1. Prepare chronologies and issue-spotting questionnaires tailored to the alleged incident or dispute.  \n   2. Obtain written statements and preserve contact details for all witnesses.\n\nB. Document Retrieval  \n   1. Public Records  \n      \u2022 Court dockets (federal PACER, state e-filing portals).  \n      \u2022 Real estate records (county recorder\u2019s office).  \n      \u2022 Business filings (secretary of state databases).  \n      \u2022 Police/fire incident reports and 911 records.  \n   2. Freedom of Information Requests  \n      \u2022 Draft FOIA or state-equivalent requests for agency reports, inspection records, etc.  \n   3. Medical and Employment Records  \n      \u2022 Secure HIPAA-compliant authorizations.  \n      \u2022 Subpoena wage-loss or employment files, if relevant.\n\nC. Digital/Physical Evidence  \n   \u2022 Photographs, video surveillance, social media posts, GPS or telematics data, building maintenance logs, product design specs, etc.  \n   \u2022 Immediately send litigation-hold letters to adverse parties to avoid spoliation.\n\nD. Site Inspection  \n   \u2022 Coordinate on-site inspections with experts (engineers, safety consultants, accident-reconstructionists) where the scene or product condition is central.\n\nIII. Preliminary Legal Research Framework  \nA. Statutes of Limitation & Repose  \n   \u2022 Identify jurisdiction-specific deadlines early to avoid waiver.  \nB. Elements of Potential Claims (illustrative list; tailor to facts)  \n   1. Negligence  \n      \u2022 Duty, breach, causation, damages.  \n   2. Premises Liability  \n      \u2022 Status of plaintiff (invitee/licensee), constructive notice, hazardous condition.  \n   3. Products Liability  \n      \u2022 Manufacturing defect, design defect, failure to warn; UCC warranty claims.  \n   4. Breach of Contract  \n      \u2022 Existence of contract, breach, damages; consider implied covenant of good faith.  \n   5. Fraud/Misrepresentation  \n   6. Civil Rights (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or state analogues)  \n   7. Employment-related (discrimination, wrongful termination, wage-and-hour)\n\nC. Key Sources to Consult  \n   \u2022 Statutory codes (Lexis/Westlaw; free sources like govinfo.gov, state legislative websites).  \n   \u2022 Restatements, treatises, and practice guides.  \n   \u2022 Federal and state case law (use headnotes to map elements of claims).  \n   \u2022 Administrative regulations (OSHA, FDA, FTC, etc.).  \n   \u2022 Jury-instruction models for prima facie elements.  \n\nIV. Cause-of-Action Matrix (Template)  \n\n| Potential Claim | Key Elements | Available Evidence | Additional Discovery Needed | Limitation Deadline |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Negligence      | Duty, breach, proximate cause, damages | CCTV footage; witness A statement | Maintenance logs; expert report | mm/dd/yyyy |\n| \u2026               | \u2026            | \u2026                  | \u2026                           | \u2026 |\n\nV. Discovery & Pleadings Roadmap  \n1. Draft initial complaint once the matrix confirms viable claims.  \n2. Serve Rule 26(a) disclosures (or state equivalent).  \n3. Craft targeted interrogatories, RFPs, and RFAs aligned with above elements.  \n4. Schedule depositions of fact witnesses and designated corporate reps (Rule 30(b)(6)).  \n\nVI. Case File Organization  \n\u2022 Create indexed folders: \u201cPleadings,\u201d \u201cDiscovery,\u201d \u201cEvidence\u2014Digital,\u201d \u201cEvidence\u2014Physical,\u201d \u201cResearch,\u201d and \u201cExpert Materials.\u201d  \n\u2022 Maintain privilege logs; apply Bates numbers to all produced documents.  \n\nVII. Risk Assessment & Next Steps  \nA. Liability Strength: [Low / Moderate / High] (update after initial discovery)  \nB. Damages Exposure: Economic $___; Non-economic $___; Punitive viability.  \nC. Insurance Coverage: Identify applicable policies and reservation-of-rights issues.  \nD. Settlement Posture: Evaluate early mediation versus post-discovery evaluation.  \n\nPlease advise if additional jurisdiction-specific research or specialized expert engagement is required before proceeding to draft pleadings or settlement correspondence.\n\n[Your Name]  \nSenior Paralegal  \n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
