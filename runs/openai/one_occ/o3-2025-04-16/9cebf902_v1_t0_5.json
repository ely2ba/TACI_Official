Jurisdiction(s):  \n   \u2022 Which state(s), territory, or federal jurisdiction is involved?  \n   \u2022 Are there any cross-border or international aspects?\n\n2. Legal Topic / Cause of Action:  \n   \u2022 What specific area of law is at issue (e.g., contract breach, employment discrimination, trademark infringement, personal injury, immigration, tax, etc.)?  \n   \u2022 Are there particular statutes or regulations the client is concerned about?\n\n3. Relevant Facts:  \n   \u2022 A concise statement of the key facts (dates, parties, events, contracts, communications, alleged damages, etc.).  \n   \u2022 Procedural posture, if the matter is already in litigation or administrative proceedings.\n\n4. Client Goals / Questions:  \n   \u2022 What outcome does the client seek (e.g., settlement, injunction, compliance advice, risk assessment)?  \n   \u2022 Are there specific questions the memo must answer?\n\n5. Timing and Deliverables:  \n   \u2022 Any filing deadlines or court dates?  \n   \u2022 Preferred memo length or format requirements?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can gather the pertinent statutes, case law, secondary sources, and draft a comprehensive analysis tailored to the client\u2019s needs.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
