PURPOSE  \nThis memo summarizes the procedural requirements, deadlines, and best-practice recommendations for filing pleadings with the [Name of Court] Clerk\u2019s Office in [Jurisdiction]. It is intended to ensure that all forthcoming filings are accepted without deficiency notices and are entered on the docket in a timely manner.\n\nII. KEY FACTS  \n\u2022 Matter: [Case Name], Case No. [XXXX-#####]  \n\u2022 Pleadings to be filed: (1) Plaintiff\u2019s First Amended Complaint; (2) Civil Case Cover Sheet; (3) Summons for issuance.  \n\u2022 Applicable rules: [Jurisdiction] Rules of Civil Procedure (\u201cRCP\u201d) 3, 5, 7, and local rule LR 1.1; Standing Order 22-04 (Electronic Filing).  \n\u2022 Filing method: Mandatory e-filing via the Court\u2019s Electronic Filing System (\u201cEFS\u201d).  \n\nIII. PROCEDURAL CHECKLIST  \n\nA. Pre-Filing Review  \n1. Caption: verify full style of the case; include court division and case number.  \n2. Signature block: attorney\u2019s name, bar number, email, phone, physical address per RCP 11(a).  \n3. Certificate of Service: must list all counsel of record and delivery method (EFS constitutes service on registered users; non-EFS parties require separate service).  \n4. Word/Page Limits: not applicable to complaints but check LR 7.1 for any attachments.  \n5. Exhibits: combine each exhibit with a bookmark; label sequentially (Ex. A, Ex. B, etc.).  \n\nB. Technical Specifications (E-Filing)  \n\u2022 Format: text-searchable PDF, 300 dpi, \u2264 25 MB per file; larger files must be segmented.  \n\u2022 Naming convention: \u201c2024-05-20_Amended Complaint.pdf\u201d per Clerk\u2019s E-Guide \u00a7 4.2.  \n\u2022 Proposed Summons: upload as separate \u201cProposed\u201d event category.  \n\nC. Filing Fees  \n\u2022 Amended Complaint: no additional filing fee (initial $402 paid on 03/15/24).  \n\u2022 Summons issuance fee: $0 (covered in civil filing fee).  \n\nD. Timing & Deadlines  \n\u2022 RCP 15(a)(1)(B): amended complaint may be filed once as of right within 21 days of service of a responsive pleading; deadline = 05/24/2024.  \n\u2022 Clerk\u2019s Office cut-off: filings received by 11:59 p.m. local time are deemed filed that day; recommend upload by 4:30 p.m. to allow error correction.  \n\nE. Post-Filing Tasks  \n1. Retrieve Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF) and confirm docket entry.  \n2. Calendar service deadlines for summons once issued (Rule 4(m): 90 days).  \n3. Save file-stamped copies to client folder and share with attorney team.  \n\nIV. RECOMMENDED ACTION STEPS  \n1. Finalize pleadings and exhibits; run QC per \u00a7 III.A-B by COB 05/17/24.  \n2.

Monitor docket for summons issuance and immediately arrange service through [Process Server] upon receipt.  \n\nV. RISKS & MITIGATION  \n\u2022 Risk: filing after 21-day amendment window \u2192 potential need for leave of court.  \n  Mitigation: adhere to 05/20/24 internal deadline.  \n\u2022 Risk: PDF technical rejection \u2192 delayed filing date.  \n  Mitigation: pre-upload validation; keep backup PDF copies.  \n\u2022 Risk: deficient certificate of service \u2192 clerk notice.  \n  Mitigation: cross-check recipient list with CM/ECF Service List immediately before filing.  \n\nVI. ENCLOSURES  \n1. Filing Checklist (1 page)  \n2. Draft Amended Complaint (clean & redline)  \n3. Draft Civil Case Cover Sheet  \n4. Draft Summons  \n\nPlease advise if any revisions are needed before e-filing. I will stand by for final authorization.\n\nCc: Litigation Support, File\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
