Background  \nBuyer (\u201cSmith\u201d) and Seller (\u201cJohnson\u201d) executed a Purchase-and-Sale Agreement (PSA) dated 2 April 20XX for the property located at 123 Elm Street. Scheduled closing is 30 June 20XX. Two disputes have arisen:  \n1. Allocation of responsibility for repairing a boundary fence discovered to encroach 1.2 feet onto neighbor\u2019s lot.  \n2. Prorated real property tax adjustment methodology (Seller proposes calendar-year basis; Buyer insists on fiscal-year basis).  \n\nThe PSA incorporates the American Arbitration Association (AAA) Residential Real Estate Arbitration Rules and requires binding arbitration for any dispute that cannot be resolved within ten (10) days\u2019 written notice.\n\nAdditionally, the preliminary title commitment (First Fidelity Title, Commitment No. 22-4567) raises three exceptions that must be cleared or insured over before closing:\n\n\u2022 Exception 4: Unreleased mortgage (Book 2143, Page 556)-\u2013 payoff recorded as \u201csatisfied\u201d but no discharge of mortgage recorded.  \n\u2022 Exception 7: Boundary line overlap per Survey Ref. Map 19-B (fence encroachment noted above).  \n\u2022 Exception 9: Municipal lien for sidewalk assessment\u2014$2,845 outstanding.  \n\nII. Arbitration Preparation  \n\nA. Procedural Steps  \n1. Issue Written Demand: Draft and serve a \u201cNotice of Dispute and Demand for Arbitration\u201d on the opposing party, copying AAA and filing online with AAA\u2019s case-filing portal.  \n2. Select Arbitrator: PSA requires selection from AAA\u2019s real estate neutrals panel within 5 business days; otherwise AAA appoints. Prepare ranked list; consider candidates with land-use experience.  \n3. Preliminary Hearing: Prepare agenda (scope, schedule, exchange of documents). Request a single, expedited evidentiary hearing\u2014goal: decision no later than 20 June 20XX to preserve closing date.  \n4. Discovery: Exchange (a) surveyor\u2019s report; (b) contractor repair estimates; (c) county tax billing statements; (d) email negotiations on tax proration.  \n5. Legal Positions  \n   \u2022 Fence Repair: Argue PSA \u00a76(c) obligates Seller to convey marketable title \u201cfree of encroachments.\u201d Cost to move fence (~$3,100) is Seller\u2019s responsibility or credit at closing.  \n   \u2022 Tax Proration: PSA \u00a78 uses term \u201ccurrent tax year,\u201d which parties failed to define. Cite state case law (Brown v. Green, 312 So.3d 455) favoring calendar-year proration absent express language.  \n\nB. Settlement Opportunity  \nBefore incurring arbitration fees (~$3,000 filing + arbitrator hourly), recommend mediation-style session concurrent with preliminary hearing. Potential compromise: Seller to pay 75 % of fence relocation and accept calendar-year proration; Buyer absorbs remainder.\n\nIII. Title Commitment Review & Curative Measures  \n\nException 4 \u2013 Unreleased Mortgage  \n\u2022 Contact prior lender (First Union Bank, now Wells Fargo) for recorded discharge.  \n\u2022 If discharge cannot be obtained before closing, draft \u201cAffidavit of Lost Satisfaction\u201d and indemnity from Seller; request title insurer issue affirmative coverage endorsement (CLTA 116).  \n\nException 7 \u2013 Boundary Encroachment  \n\u2022 Obtain updated ALTA survey confirming 1.2-ft encroachment.  \n\u2022 Record Boundary Line Agreement with neighbor (Lot 5) or secure \u201cFence Encroachment Endorsement\u201d (ALTA 28.3) if neighbor unwilling.  \n\u2022 Ensure arbitrated outcome (repair or credit) is referenced in closing statement and escrow instructions.  \n\nException 9 \u2013 Municipal Lien  \n\u2022 Order payoff from City Treasurer; obtain \u201cLien Satisfaction Certificate\u201d upon payment from Seller\u2019s proceeds. Confirm municipal release will be recorded or indexed by closing date.  \n\nIV. Closing Checklist & Timeline  \n\nDate            Task/Responsible Party  \n05 May         Serve Arbitration Demand (Paralegal)  \n08 May         Rank Arbitrator List (Attorney/Client)  \n15 May         Preliminary Hearing; seek mediated settlement  \n20 May         Submit joint stipulation of resolved issues or proceed to final hearing  \n10 Jun          Final Arbitration Award, if necessary  \n15 Jun          Record discharge or affidavit re: mortgage (Title Company)  \n18 Jun          Final ALTA survey and boundary agreement/endorsement filed  \n25 Jun          Obtain lien satisfaction; clearance confirmed  \n27 Jun          Issue final title policy pro forma; approve Closing Disclosure  \n30 Jun          Closing\u2014execute deeds, loan docs; disburse funds; remit title policy  \n\nV. Recommendations  \n\n1. Proceed with arbitration demand immediately to preserve rights and maintain timeline.  \n2. Push for early mediated settlement to minimize costs and uncertainty.  \n3. Simultaneously cure title exceptions to avoid last-minute delays; secure necessary endorsements so closing can proceed even if fence issue remains under arbitration.  \n4. Update client weekly; flag any slippage that threatens 30 June closing.  \n\nPlease advise if you wish to adjust strategy or require additional research (e.g., state-specific proration statutes, alternative title endorsements). I am prepared to draft the demand, coordinate with AAA, and liaise with surveyor and title underwriter upon approval.\n\nRespectfully submitted,  \n[Paralegal Name]  \nSenior Paralegal  \n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
