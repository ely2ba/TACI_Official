          "content": "<OUTPUT_TEXT>\nBelow is a practical, step-by-step workflow a paralegal or legal assistant can follow to investigate facts and law, locate pertinent sources, identify potential causes of action, and help prepare a case for filing or trial.\n\n1. Clarify the Assignment  \n   \u2022 Obtain a clear statement of objectives from supervising attorney (e.g., potential tort, contract breach, statutory claim).  \n   \u2022 Confirm deadlines, budget limits, scope (jurisdiction, time period, subjects).\n\n2. Conduct Preliminary Issue-Spotting  \n   \u2022 Review intake forms, client interview notes, prior pleadings, correspondence.  \n   \u2022 Identify the parties, relevant dates, transactions, injuries, and potential legal theories.  \n   \u2022 Draft a preliminary list of possible causes of action and required elements of proof.\n\n3. Fact-Gathering and Evidence Collection  \n   A. Public Records  \n      \u2013 Court dockets and filings (PACER, state e-filing systems).  \n      \u2013 Property deeds, tax assessor data, UCC filings.  \n      \u2013 Corporate records (secretary of state, FINRA, SEC EDGAR).  \n      \u2013 Professional licenses, disciplinary records.  \n      \u2013 Vital statistics (birth, death, marriage).  \n      \u2013 Police reports, accident reports, incident logs.  \n   B. Internet & Open-Source Intelligence  \n      \u2013 Social-media accounts, archived webpages (Wayback Machine).  \n      \u2013 News databases (LexisNexis, Westlaw News, ProQuest).  \n      \u2013 Industry or trade publications, company press releases.  \n   C. Private & Commercial Databases  \n      \u2013 Accurint, CLEAR, TLOxp for skip tracing, asset searches.  \n      \u2013 BloombergLaw, Docket Navigator for litigation analytics.  \n   D. Client & Third-Party Materials  \n      \u2013 Contracts, emails, photographs, medical records (with HIPAA authorizations).  \n      \u2013 Expert reports, insurance files, employment files, HR manuals.  \n   E. Interviews & Declarations  \n      \u2013 Schedule and summarize witness or party interviews.  \n      \u2013 Obtain affidavits or declarations where needed.\n\n4. Organize and Preserve Evidence  \n   \u2022 Create a Bates-numbered repository (cloud or document-management system).  \n   \u2022 Maintain chain-of-custody log for physical evidence and digital metadata.  \n   \u2022 Draft master index, fact chronology, and \u201chot doc\u201d list.\n\n5. Legal Research  \n   \u2022 Statutes, rules, regulations (federal, state, local) via Westlaw, Lexis, Fastcase, govInfo.  \n   \u2022 Case law: find controlling precedent, note procedural posture and holdings.  \n   \u2022 Secondary sources: practice guides (e.g., Causes of Action series), treatises, restatements, law review articles, jury instructions.  \n   \u2022 Check for recent amendments, pending legislation, or circuit splits.\n\n6. Map Elements of Each Potential Claim  \n   \u2022 Create a matrix: Column A = elements; Column B = supporting facts/evidence; Column C = evidentiary gaps.  \n   \u2022 Note applicable statute of limitations and jurisdictional prerequisites (e.g., administrative exhaustion, notice requirements).\n\n7. Analyze Defenses & Counterclaims  \n   \u2022 Affirmative defenses (e.g., comparative fault, statute of repose, contractual waiver).  \n   \u2022 Immunities, preemption, arbitration clauses.  \n   \u2022 Potential counterclaims against client.\n\n8. Prepare Attorney Work Product  \n   \u2022 Research memorandum summarizing facts, applicable law, likelihood of success, and recommended causes of action.  \n   \u2022 Annotated list of key cases and statutory citations.  \n   \u2022 Draft complaint, petition, or demand letter templates with placeholder facts.  \n   \u2022 Draft discovery plan: initial disclosures, interrogatories, RFPs, subpoenas, deposition outlines.  \n   \u2022 Damages worksheet (economic, non-economic, punitive).\n\n9. Compliance and Ethical Safeguards  \n   \u2022 Verify all investigative methods comply with FCRA, GLBA, Privacy Acts, state wiretap & investigator licensing laws.  \n   \u2022 Avoid UPL (unauthorized practice of law); submit drafts for attorney review.  \n   \u2022 Maintain confidentiality (ABA Model Rule 1.6) and data-security protocols.\n\n10. Continual Updating  \n   \u2022 Set docket alerts and news alerts for parties, statutes, and cases.  \n   \u2022 Log ongoing research in a project management tool or research trail.  \n   \u2022 Periodically reassess causes of action as new facts emerge.\n\nFollowing this structured approach ensures comprehensive fact development, accurate legal research, and timely preparation of case documents, positioning the supervising attorney\u2014and ultimately the client\u2014for the strongest possible litigation stance or negotiation leverage.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
