CASE INTAKE & FILE OPENING  \n   1.1 Use a standardized intake form capturing client identity, matter description, conflict-check data, SOL/critical dates.  \n   1.2 Perform immediate conflict check in the practice-management system; escalate any hits to supervising attorney.  \n   1.3 Assign a unique file number; create digital and physical folders using uniform naming convention (e.g., \u201c2024-05-Smith v. Jones-PL\u201d).  \n   1.4 Enter matter-level permissions so only the case team can access confidential files.  \n\n2. CALENDAR & DEADLINE CONTROL  \n   2.1 Dual-calendar rule: record every deadline in (a) cloud calendar with reminder layering (14-7-1 days) and (b) paper \u201cmaster docket.\u201d  \n   2.2 Color-code: court dates (red), client meetings (blue), discovery (orange), subpoena returns (green).  \n   2.3 Conduct weekly \u201cdocket review\u201d meeting to verify upcoming tasks and reallocate workload.  \n\n3. DOCUMENT DRAFTING & QUALITY ASSURANCE  \n   3.1 Employ firm templates stored in a version-controlled repository; update cites and local-rule references quarterly.  \n   3.2 Use a three-tier review chain: drafter \u2192 senior paralegal \u2192 attorney. Log each stage in the document-history sheet.  \n   3.3 Apply OCR & Bates labeling on all incoming production within 24 h; update the exhibit index.  \n\n4. SUBPOENA PREPARATION  \n   4.1 Confirm jurisdiction and court rule (e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 45 or state analogue).  \n   4.2 Verify witness/entity address and registered agent through SOS database or commercial locator.  \n   4.3 Draft subpoena, attach schedule A (documents) or witness fee check (testimony); secure attorney signature.  \n   4.4 Calendar response/appearance date and compliance deadline immediately.  \n\n5. SUBPOENA SERVICE OF PROCESS  \n   5.1 Determine proper service method: personal, certified mail, or email if court-authorized.  \n   5.2 Choose server:  \n       \u2022 In-house courier (routine, local, low-risk).  \n       \u2022 Licensed process-server (out-of-county or evasive targets).  \n       \u2022 Sheriff/constable (when statutorily required).  \n   5.3 Provide server with: copies, cover sheet with instructions, statutory fee check, and deadline.  \n   5.4 Receive and review proof of service; file with court within required time (often 7 days).  \n   5.5 If service fails, redeploy within 48 h; document attempts to preserve diligence record.  \n\n6. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS  \n   6.1 Client updates: send status email after any court filing, service event, or substantive correspondence.  \n   6.2 Opposing counsel: log all calls/emails in contact log; follow up verbal agreements with confirming letter.  \n   6.3 Internal: maintain Slack/MS Teams channel per matter; summarize at day\u2019s end for absent team members.  \n\n7. COMPLIANCE & ETHICS CHECKS  \n   7.1 Verify that subpoena scope is \u201cproportional\u201d and not unduly burdensome; obtain attorney certification.  \n   7.2 Protect privileged data: seal filings when necessary; redact SSNs, DOBs under Rule 5.2.  \n   7.3 Adhere to privacy statutes (HIPAA, GDPR) for personal data; use HIPAA authorization or Qualified Protective Order when subpoenaing medical records.  \n\n8. TECHNOLOGY & SECURITY  \n   8.1 Practice-management platform (e.g., Clio, Smokeball) as the single source of truth.  \n   8.2 Enable MFA on all accounts; encrypt drives and email attachments.  \n   8.3 Backups: nightly incremental, weekly full, off-site geo-redundant storage.  \n\n9. VENDOR & COURIER MANAGEMENT  \n   9.1 Maintain an approved vendor list with license/insurance expiration dates.  \n   9.2 Execute NDA and service-level agreement; require 24-hour turnaround on proof of service uploads.  \n   9.3 Rate vendors quarterly on timeliness, accuracy, and cost.  \n\n10. TRAINING & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT  \n    10.1 Onboard new staff with a 30-day checklist covering case-management software, confidentiality, and subpoena rules.  \n    10.2 Hold monthly lunch-and-learns on evolving rules (e-service, remote depositions).  \n    10.3 Conduct post-matter debrief: what went well, bottlenecks, lessons learned; feed into updated SOPs.  \n\nEND OF GUIDE\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
