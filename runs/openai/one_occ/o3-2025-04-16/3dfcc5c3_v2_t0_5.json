Map mandatory authorities (statutes, reporters, regulations) and secondary sources (treatises, practice guides).  \n   c. Consult attorneys periodically to detect new subject-matter needs.\n\n2. Master Inventory Control  \n   a. Create a master catalogue (spreadsheet or library-management software) listing: title, edition, publisher, ISBN/ISSN, format, subscription type, location, last update received, and responsible staff member.  \n   b. Assign unique barcodes or call numbers for quick tracking.  \n   c. Conduct a complete physical and digital audit at least annually.\n\n3. Subscription & Vendor Management  \n   a. Maintain a calendar of standing orders, loose-leaf services, pocket parts, advance sheets, and online database licenses.  \n   b. Record renewal dates, cancellation deadlines, and price-increase notification periods.  \n   c. Establish primary contacts at each publisher; negotiate group discounts and multi-format bundles.\n\n4. Monitoring and Receiving Updates  \n   a. Check incoming mail and email daily for supplements, cumulative digests, newsletters, and statute updates.  \n   b. Compare each shipment against the packing slip and master catalogue.  \n   c. Stamp or log the receipt date, then route to processing within 24 hours.\n\n5. Processing & Filing  \n   a. Verify that each update is complete (all pages, tabs, or replacement volumes present).  \n   b. File pocket parts, replace loose-leaf pages, and interfile reporters in chronological order, following publisher instructions meticulously.  \n   c. Stamp superseded pages \u201cSuperseded\u2014Do Not Rely\u201d before removal.\n\n6. Cataloguing & Indexing  \n   a. Update the library database to reflect new editions or supplements.  \n   b. Adjust call numbers if classification changes (e.g., new subject heading).  \n   c. Add cross-references and keyword tags to enhance searchability.\n\n7. Archiving & Disposal  \n   a. Retain superseded materials only if required for historical research, litigation holds, or jurisdictional mandates.  \n   b. For disposable items, shred or recycle in accordance with publisher license terms and confidential-document policies.  \n   c. Maintain an archive log noting disposition date and method.\n\n8. Digital Resource Oversight  \n   a. Track user licenses, passwords, and administrator credentials for online databases.  \n   b. Set alerts for statutory or case-law updates within each platform; disseminate noteworthy changes to attorneys.  \n   c. Ensure digital duplicates complement\u2014not unnecessarily replicate\u2014print holdings.\n\n9. Budgeting & Cost Control  \n   a. Prepare an annual acquisitions budget, forecasting inflation, new practice needs, and vendor price escalations.  \n   b. Review usage statistics (circulation counts, database analytics) to justify renewals or cancellations.  \n   c. Seek alternative formats (e-book vs. print) where cost-effective.\n\n10. Compliance & Quality Assurance  \n   a. Schedule semi-annual shelf audits: verify that each work is complete, current, and correctly shelved.  \n   b. Document discrepancies and corrective actions; report critical lapses to supervising attorney or librarian.  \n   c. Maintain written procedures and train backup staff to ensure continuity.\n\n11. Communication & Training  \n   a. Circulate monthly \u201cLibrary Update\u201d memos summarizing new arrivals, major amendments, and cancelled titles.  \n   b. Offer brief CLE-eligible sessions on locating updated materials.  \n   c. Solicit feedback to refine acquisitions strategy.\n\n12. Continuous Improvement  \n   a. Benchmark against peer law libraries and ABA/LexisNexis/Westlaw recommendations.  \n   b. Review emerging formats (AI-driven research tools, integrated citation managers).  \n   c. Update policies annually to reflect technological and regulatory developments.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
