They provide the legal framework within which individuals, businesses, and governments operate. Statutes are codified in official government publications and are accessible through various legal databases.\n\n2. **Decisions**: Legal decisions, or case law, are rulings made by courts interpreting statutes, regulations, or constitutional provisions. These decisions are published in reporters and are critical for understanding how laws are applied in specific circumstances. They also serve as precedents for future cases.\n\n3. **Legal Articles**: Legal articles, including law reviews and journals, provide analysis, commentary, and critique of existing laws and legal issues. These articles are essential for academic and professional discourse and can influence legal thinking and policy making.\n\n4. **Codes**: Legal codes are systematic collections of laws and regulations that are organized by subject matter. These can include civil codes, criminal codes, and administrative codes. They simplify the process of finding relevant laws and are updated regularly to reflect new statutes and amendments.\n\n5. **Documents**: Legal documents encompass a wide range of materials, including court filings, legal opinions, contracts, and legislative history. These documents are used to support legal arguments, provide evidence in legal disputes, and record transactions.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
