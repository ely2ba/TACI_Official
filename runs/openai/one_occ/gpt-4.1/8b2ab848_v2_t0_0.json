I would identify the core issues, clarify each party\u2019s position, and facilitate a structured discussion to encourage resolution. If necessary, I would reference applicable real estate laws and contract provisions to guide the parties toward a fair and legally sound agreement. If a settlement is reached, I would assist in drafting a written agreement reflecting the terms.\n\n2. **Assisting in the Real Estate Closing Process**  \n   - **Reviewing Title Searches:** I would examine the title search report to ensure there are no outstanding liens, encumbrances, or title defects that could affect the transfer of ownership. Any issues found would be flagged for resolution before closing.\n   - **Document Preparation and Review:** I would assist in preparing and reviewing closing documents, such as the deed, settlement statement, and any required affidavits or disclosures, ensuring compliance with state and local regulations.\n   - **Coordination:** I would coordinate with all parties involved\u2014buyers, sellers, lenders, and title companies\u2014to ensure all necessary documents are signed and funds are properly disbursed.\n   - **Final Checks:** Before closing, I would verify that all contractual obligations have been met and that the property is ready for transfer.\n\n3. **Summary**  \n   My role is to facilitate a smooth and legally compliant real estate transaction by resolving disputes impartially and ensuring all closing requirements are satisfied, with particular attention to title integrity and document accuracy.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
