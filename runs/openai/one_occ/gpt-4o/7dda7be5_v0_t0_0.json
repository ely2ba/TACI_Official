          "content": "<OUTPUT_TEXT>Appraising and inventorying real and personal property for estate planning involves several key steps. First, gather all relevant documents related to the property, such as deeds, titles, and any existing appraisals. For real property, consider hiring a professional appraiser to determine the current market value. For personal property, create a detailed list of items, including descriptions, estimated values, and any relevant documentation like receipts or appraisals. It's important to consider both tangible personal property (like jewelry, art, and vehicles) and intangible personal property (such as stocks, bonds, and intellectual property). Ensure all valuations are up-to-date and reflect fair market value. This comprehensive inventory will aid in the equitable distribution of assets and help minimize potential disputes among beneficiaries.</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
