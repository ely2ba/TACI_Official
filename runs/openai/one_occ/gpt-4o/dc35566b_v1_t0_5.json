This list should be easily accessible for quick reference during trial.\n\n6. **Prepare Exhibit Binders**: Arrange exhibits in binders or folders in the order they will be presented. Include a table of contents for easy navigation.\n\n7. **Ensure Compliance**: Verify that all exhibits comply with court rules and procedures, including any pre-trial disclosure requirements.\n\n8. **Coordinate with Witnesses**: Ensure that witnesses are familiar with the exhibits they will discuss during their testimony.\n\n9. **Digital Copies**: Prepare digital copies of all exhibits for electronic presentation if required by the court or for ease of access during trial.\n\n10. **Practice Presentation**: Conduct a mock trial or rehearsal to practice the introduction and handling of exhibits during trial.\n\nBy following these steps, you will ensure that all exhibits are organized and ready for efficient presentation during trial.</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
