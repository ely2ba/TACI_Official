This includes gathering relevant information, understanding each party's position, and assisting in drafting settlement agreements. In the real estate closing process, I review title searches to ensure there are no outstanding issues such as liens or encumbrances that could affect the transfer of ownership. I also coordinate with attorneys, real estate agents, and other stakeholders to ensure all necessary documents are prepared and executed properly, ensuring a smooth and efficient closing process.</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
