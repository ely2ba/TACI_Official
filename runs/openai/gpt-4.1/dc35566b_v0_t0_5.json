Create an exhibit list, assigning each exhibit a unique identification number or letter (e.g., Exhibit 1, Exhibit A).\n3. Label each exhibit clearly with its assigned number/letter.\n4. Prepare copies of each exhibit for the judge, opposing counsel, and witnesses, as required by local court rules.\n5. Assemble exhibits in the order they will be introduced at trial, and maintain a master set in a secure, easily accessible location.\n6. Prepare an exhibit binder or folder for counsel and the court.\n7. Draft an exhibit log or chart to track the admission status of each exhibit during trial.\n8. Confirm with the attorney any stipulations or objections regarding exhibits with opposing counsel.\n9. Prepare any necessary foundational documents or witnesses for exhibit authentication.\n10. Ensure all exhibits comply with court rules regarding formatting, confidentiality, and redaction.\n\nThese steps will help ensure exhibits are organized, accessible, and ready for efficient use during trial.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
