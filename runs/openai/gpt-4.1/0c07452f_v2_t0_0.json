Use age-appropriate language and provide examples to ensure understanding.\n\n2. **Model Expected Behavior**  \n   Demonstrate adherence to all school rules and policies in your own actions. Students are more likely to follow rules when they see adults doing the same.\n\n3. **Consistent Enforcement**  \n   Apply rules consistently and fairly to all students. Avoid favoritism and ensure that consequences for breaking rules are predictable and appropriate.\n\n4. **Positive Reinforcement**  \n   Recognize and reward students who follow rules and demonstrate positive behavior. This encourages others to do the same.\n\n5. **Address Infractions Promptly**  \n   When a rule is broken, address the behavior immediately and calmly. Explain which rule was violated and why it is important.\n\n6. **Document and Report**  \n   Keep records of repeated or serious infractions and communicate with administration and parents as required by school policy.\n\n7. **Support and Guidance**  \n   Offer support to students who struggle with following rules. Work with them to develop strategies for improvement and involve counselors if necessary.\n\n8. **Collaborate with Administration**  \n   Stay informed about updates to policies and participate in staff meetings or trainings related to student conduct and school rules.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
