Research shows that guided play with supportive adults and peers fosters creativity, problem-solving, and social skills.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can get involved:\n\n1. **Parent Volunteers:**  \n   - Assist in setting up and supervising play centers (e.g., building, dramatic play, science exploration).\n   - Facilitate small group activities, encouraging children to collaborate and extend their ideas.\n   - Share special skills or interests (e.g., gardening, music, crafts) to enrich play themes.\n\n2. **Older Student Mentors:**  \n   - Partner with younger students during structured play sessions.\n   - Model positive social interactions and help guide complex play scenarios.\n   - Support teachers in organizing materials and leading group games or projects.\n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Interested parents, please sign up via the volunteer form sent home or contact the classroom teacher directly.\n- Older students will be selected and trained through our school\u2019s leadership program.\n\nBy working together, we can create a vibrant, supportive environment where all children thrive through meaningful play. Thank you for your partnership!\n\nSincerely,  \n[Your Name]  \nSenior Elementary School Teacher\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
