Use tools like Gartner Hype Cycle and Google Trends to assess adoption rates and public interest. Map these trends against your current product portfolio and customer segments to identify gaps or opportunities. For example, if AI-driven automation is rising in manufacturing, consider developing products with integrated AI features or enhancing existing offerings with smart capabilities. Additionally, monitor competitor activity and customer feedback to refine your strategy, ensuring alignment with evolving market demands and maximizing sales potential.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
