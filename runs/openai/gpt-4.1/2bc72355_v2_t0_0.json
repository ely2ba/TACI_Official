I use visuals, real-life examples, and interactive questions to keep students engaged and help them understand the material.\n\n2. **Discussions**\n   - I encourage students to share their ideas and ask questions, both in small groups and as a class. This helps them think critically, listen to others, and express their own thoughts. I guide discussions to ensure everyone participates and stays on topic.\n\n3. **Demonstrations**\n   - I show students how to complete tasks or solve problems by modeling the steps. For example, I might demonstrate a science experiment or how to solve a math problem on the board. Students can then try the activity themselves, either individually or in groups.\n\n4. **Individual Instruction**\n   - I work one-on-one with students who need extra help or want to explore topics further. I tailor my teaching to their needs, using different strategies and materials to support their learning.\n\n5. **Group Instruction**\n   - I organize students into small groups for collaborative activities. Each group works together to solve problems, complete projects, or discuss ideas. I monitor their progress, provide guidance, and encourage teamwork.\n\n6. **Adapting Methods**\n   - I adjust my teaching methods based on the subject, students\u2019 learning styles, and their progress. This ensures that all students have the opportunity to succeed and enjoy learning.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
