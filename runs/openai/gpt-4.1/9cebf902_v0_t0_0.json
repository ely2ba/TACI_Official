To gather and analyze research data such as statutes, decisions, legal articles, codes, and documents, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Legal Issue or Topic**: Clearly define the legal question or subject matter you are researching.\n\n2. **Gather Primary Sources**:\n   - **Statutes and Codes**: Use official government websites, legal databases (e.g., Westlaw, LexisNexis), or state legislative websites to find relevant statutes and codes.\n   - **Case Law (Decisions)**: Search for judicial decisions using legal research platforms. Filter by jurisdiction and date as needed.\n\n3. **Gather Secondary Sources**:\n   - **Legal Articles and Journals**: Access law reviews, legal periodicals, and scholarly articles through databases like HeinOnline, JSTOR, or Google Scholar.\n   - **Legal Encyclopedias and Treatises**: Use resources such as American Jurisprudence (AmJur) or Corpus Juris Secundum (CJS) for background and analysis.\n\n4. **Analyze the Data**:\n   - **Statutes and Codes**: Read the text carefully, noting definitions, elements, and exceptions. Check for amendments or repeals.\n   - **Case Law**: Summarize the facts, issues, holdings, and reasoning. Note how courts interpret statutes or apply legal principles.\n   - **Legal Articles**: Extract key arguments, commentary, and citations to primary law.\n\n5. **Synthesize Findings**:\n   - Compare and contrast different sources.\n   - Identify trends, conflicts, or consensus in the law.\n   - Prepare a memorandum or report summarizing your findings, with citations.\n\n6. **Document and Organize**:\n   - Keep detailed records of sources and citations.\n   - Organize research materials for easy reference.\n\nIf you have a specific legal issue or jurisdiction in mind, please provide more details for tailored research and analysis.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
