Notably, the Sales Performance and Customer Segmentation dashboards now include advanced filtering and drill-down capabilities.\n   - Automated scheduling and distribution options are now available, allowing users to receive updated reports directly via email or within the BI portal.\n\n3. **Metadata Improvements**  \n   - The data catalog has been expanded with detailed business definitions, data lineage, and usage notes for all major datasets. This enhancement supports better data governance and user self-service.\n   - A new metadata search function has been implemented, making it easier to locate relevant datasets and understand their context.\n\nWe encourage all users to explore these enhancements and provide feedback. Training sessions and updated documentation are available upon request. Please reach out to the BI team for further assistance or to schedule a demonstration.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \nSenior Business Intelligence Analyst\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
