I would then contact the appropriate representative from the supplier or carrier, providing detailed information about the problem, including order numbers, item descriptions, and photographic evidence if available. Through clear communication\u2014either by phone, email, or official correspondence\u2014I would work collaboratively to determine the cause of the issue and agree on corrective actions, such as replacement shipments, credits, or returns. I would document all communications and resolutions for record-keeping and follow up to ensure the problem is fully rectified.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
