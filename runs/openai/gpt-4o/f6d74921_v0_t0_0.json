These sessions can be designed around specific themes or projects that require teamwork and creativity, such as building a model city, creating a play, or conducting simple science experiments. By assigning roles and responsibilities to both parents and older students, you can ensure that they are actively engaged and contributing to the children's learning experience. Additionally, providing training or guidelines on how to effectively support and interact with the children can enhance the quality of involvement and ensure that the play remains focused and complex.</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
