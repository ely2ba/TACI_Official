Use simple language and relate the content to the student's interests to maintain engagement.\n   - **Group Instruction**: In a group setting, use lectures to introduce new topics. Keep them interactive by asking questions and encouraging students to share their thoughts.\n\n2. **Discussions**\n   - **Individual Instruction**: Engage the student in a one-on-one discussion to explore their understanding of a topic. Ask open-ended questions to encourage critical thinking and allow the student to express their ideas.\n   - **Group Instruction**: Facilitate group discussions by posing a question or problem for the class to solve together. Encourage students to listen to each other and build on each other's ideas.\n\n3. **Demonstrations**\n   - **Individual Instruction**: Demonstrate a concept or skill to the student, then allow them to try it themselves. Provide immediate feedback and support as needed.\n   - **Group Instruction**: Conduct demonstrations in front of the class to visually explain a concept. Involve students by asking for volunteers to participate or by having them predict outcomes before the demonstration.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
