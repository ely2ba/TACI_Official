When answering telephones, it's important to first greet the caller politely, identify yourself and the organization, and ask how you may assist them. Once you understand the caller's needs, you can then direct their call to the appropriate staff member or department. For example, if a caller needs to speak with a nurse about a medical concern, you would transfer the call to the nursing department. If the caller has a billing question, you would direct them to the billing department. Always ensure to confirm the transfer with the caller and provide any necessary information, such as the name of the person they will be speaking with.</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
