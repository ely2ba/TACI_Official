I will then organize a schedule that allows for a rotation of volunteers so that everyone gets a chance to participate. The activities will be designed to promote focused, complex play, such as building projects, science experiments, and group games. I will provide guidance and support to the volunteers to ensure they understand their roles and can effectively engage with the children.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
