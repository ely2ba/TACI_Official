This could include reading to the children, helping with craft projects, assisting in science experiments, or participating in outdoor games. I will also provide training sessions for volunteers to understand the objectives of these activities and how they can best assist. I will plan these activities in such a way that they encourage children to engage in focused, complex play, which is crucial for their cognitive development.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
