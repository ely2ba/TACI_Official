Answer the phone promptly and professionally. Always greet the caller with a warm, clear and professional greeting. Identify yourself and our practice.\n\n2. Listen carefully to the caller's needs, and ask clarifying questions if necessary. This will help in directing the call to the right staff member.\n\n3. If the person the caller is trying to reach is unavailable, take a detailed message including the caller's name, contact information, and reason for calling. \n\n4. If the caller is a patient with a medical question or concern, please direct them to a nurse or doctor. \n\n5. For billing or insurance inquiries, please direct the call to our billing department.\n\n6. Always end the call courteously, assuring the caller that their query or concern will be addressed promptly.\n\nBy following these guidelines, we will ensure that our office runs smoothly and our patients feel heard and cared for. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nBest Regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nSenior Medical Secretary and Administrative Assistant\n\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
