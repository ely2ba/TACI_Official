This includes everything from dress code, behavior in class, respect for others, and adherence to school-wide procedures. It's important for students to understand the reasons behind these rules, and I will take the time to explain them in a way that is age-appropriate and easy to understand. In case of any infractions, I will follow the school's disciplinary procedures while ensuring the student's dignity and learning needs are respected. I will also communicate with parents about their child's behavior and any disciplinary actions taken, if necessary.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
