These could be complex play activities such as team sports, drama, science experiments, or art projects.\n\n2. **Recruit Volunteers**\n   Send out a call for parent volunteers and older students. This could be done through newsletters, emails, or parent-teacher meetings. Explain the benefits of their involvement, such as fostering a sense of community and enhancing the learning experience for the children.\n\n3. **Training Session**\n   Organize a training session for the volunteers. This will help them understand their roles and responsibilities, and how they can best support the children during the activities.\n\n4. **Schedule the Activities**\n   Create a schedule for the activities, ensuring that there are always enough volunteers present. This could involve creating a rota or asking for volunteers for specific dates and times.\n\n5. **Monitor and Provide Feedback**\n   Monitor the activities and provide feedback to the volunteers. This will help them improve their skills and ensure that the children are getting the most out of the activities.\n\n6. **Appreciation**\n   Show appreciation for the volunteers' time and effort. This could be through verbal recognition, thank you notes, or small tokens of appreciation. This will encourage them to continue volunteering and inspire others to do the same.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
