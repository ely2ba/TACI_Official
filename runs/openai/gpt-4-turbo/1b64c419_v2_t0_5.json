For example, \"Good morning, Dr. Smith's office, how can I help you?\"\n\n2. **Identifying the Caller's Need**: Politely ask the caller to describe the purpose of their call. You might say, \"May I know the reason for your call so I can assist you better?\"\n\n3. **Directing the Call**: Based on the caller's response, determine which staff member or department is best suited to handle the request. For instance, if it's a medical query, direct the call to a nurse or medical assistant; if it's administrative, direct it to the appropriate administrative staff.\n\n4. **Transferring the Call**: Inform the caller whom you are transferring the call to. Say something like, \"I will connect you to our nurse, Ms. Johnson, who can help you with your medical questions.\"\n\n5. **Ending the Call**: Before transferring, thank the caller for their patience. Say, \"Thank you for calling, I am transferring you now. Have a great day!\"\n\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
