Identify key issues and search terms related to the case.\n\n2. Utilize legal research databases (e.g. Westlaw, LexisNexis) to locate relevant:\n   - Statutes and regulations\n   - Case law and court decisions \n   - Law review articles and secondary sources\n\n3. Review legislative history and intent for statutory interpretation.\n\n4. Analyze cases for precedential value, distinguishing facts, and legal reasoning.\n\n5. Cross-reference citations to find related authority.\n\n6. Organize findings by issue, jurisdiction, and persuasive weight.\n\n7. Synthesize information to identify trends, conflicts, and gaps in the law.\n\n8. Prepare concise case summaries and statutory analyses.\n\n9. Update research regularly to capture new developments.\n\n10. Consult practice guides and treatises for additional context.\n\nThis systematic approach will ensure thorough and reliable legal research to support case strategy and decision-making.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
