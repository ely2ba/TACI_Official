To achieve this, we are seeking parent volunteers and older students to assist in facilitating these activities.\n\nParent Volunteers:\n• We invite parents to sign up for weekly or bi-weekly slots to help guide small group activities.\n• Activities will include structured play, problem-solving tasks, and creative projects.\n• Training and materials will be provided to ensure a consistent approach.\n\nOlder Student Mentors:\n• Students from higher grades will be paired with younger children as \"play buddies.\"\n• They will assist in modeling complex play scenarios and encouraging critical thinking.\n• This program will foster leadership skills in our older students while benefiting younger learners.\n\nIf you are interested in participating or have any questions, please contact the school office. Together, we can create a rich, engaging learning environment that promotes cognitive and social development through play.\n\nThank you for your support and involvement in our school community.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\nSenior Elementary School Teacher\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
