Created a master exhibit list in Excel with columns for exhibit number, description, date, and notes\n2. Assigned unique exhibit numbers to all potential trial exhibits\n3. Organized physical copies of exhibits in numbered binders with tabs\n4. Scanned all exhibits and saved digital copies in a dedicated trial folder on our secure server\n5. Prepared exhibit stickers and affixed them to the original exhibits\n6. Cross-referenced exhibits with key witness testimony and relevant legal arguments\n7. Flagged any potential objectionable exhibits for attorney review\n8. Created a separate list of demonstrative exhibits and visual aids\n9. Confirmed we have at least 3 copies of each exhibit (original, attorney copy, witness copy)\n10. Prepared an exhibit box with supplies like stickers, tabs, and highlighters for use during trial\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information or assistance with exhibit preparation. I will continue to update the master exhibit list as we finalize our trial strategy.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
