To achieve this, we are seeking parent volunteers and older students to assist in facilitating these activities.\n\nParent Volunteers:\n- We invite parents to sign up for weekly or bi-weekly time slots to help guide small group activities.\n- Activities may include building projects, science experiments, or creative storytelling sessions.\n- Training and materials will be provided to ensure a smooth experience for both volunteers and students.\n\nOlder Student Mentors:\n- We are partnering with the local middle and high schools to involve older students in mentoring roles.\n- These students will assist with reading groups, math games, and technology-based learning activities.\n- This program will foster leadership skills in older students while providing positive role models for our elementary learners.\n\nBy involving parent volunteers and older students, we aim to create a rich, collaborative learning environment that encourages complex thinking and problem-solving skills. If you are interested in participating or have any questions, please contact the school office.\n\nThank you for your support in enhancing our students' educational experiences.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\nSenior Elementary School Teacher\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
