Please follow these guidelines when answering calls:\n• Answer the phone within 3 rings with a friendly greeting: \"Good morning/afternoon, [Practice Name], this is [Your Name]. How may I assist you today?\"\n• Listen carefully to the caller's request or inquiry. If the call is for a provider or other staff member, politely say \"Please hold while I transfer you\" and transfer the call to the appropriate extension.\n• If the staff member is unavailable, offer to take a message or send to voicemail: \"Dr. [Name] is with a patient at the moment. Would you like me to take a message or send you to Dr. [Name]'s confidential voicemail?\"\n• For general inquiries, answer the caller's questions if you are able to do so. If not, transfer to the appropriate staff member for assistance.\n• Always thank the caller at the end of the conversation.\nBy following these telephone protocols consistently, we will ensure our patients and callers receive the responsive, high-quality service they expect from our practice. Please let me know if you have any questions.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
