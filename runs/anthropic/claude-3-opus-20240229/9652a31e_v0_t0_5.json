Contact the supplier or vendor representative to notify them of the issue and provide relevant details (e.g. item numbers, quantities, descriptions of problems).\n\n2. Request a return authorization for the affected items to ship them back to the supplier. \n\n3. Negotiate with the supplier to receive a refund, replacement product, or other appropriate remedy based on our purchasing agreement and the severity of the issue.\n\n4. Document all correspondence and keep records of returned items, credits issued, replacement products received, etc.\n\n5. Update inventory records to reflect changes once the issue is resolved.\n\n6. Follow up with the supplier as needed to ensure the problem is fully rectified and to prevent similar issues in the future by reinforcing product specifications and quality requirements.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
