We should explore developing AI-powered products to automate tasks for our customers. AI can also be leveraged to optimize our sales and marketing efforts by predicting customer needs and personalizing outreach.\n\nInternet of Things (IoT)\nThe proliferation of internet-connected devices is creating vast new markets in both the consumer and industrial sectors. We should consider developing IoT products that connect to our cloud platform and provide valuable data and controls to users. IoT devices and sensors can also be used to make our own manufacturing and supply chain more efficient.\n\nCloud Computing\nCloud adoption continues to accelerate as more companies move their IT infrastructure and applications to the cloud. Developing all new products as cloud-native applications will make them more scalable and accessible to customers. Migrating our existing products to the cloud will also make them easier to deploy and manage, potentially increasing sales.\n\n5G Wireless\nAs 5G networks roll out globally, there will be rising demand for products that take advantage of 5G's high bandwidth and low latency. We should design products that leverage 5G connectivity to enable innovative new use cases and applications. 5G's capabilities will also allow us to enhance our existing products with more real-time features and richer content.\n\nBy investing in these key technology areas, we can develop differentiated new products that give us a competitive advantage while also making our current offerings more attractive to customers. I recommend assembling a cross-functional team to further evaluate the product opportunities and develop a technology roadmap to guide our efforts.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
