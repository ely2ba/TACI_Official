Greet callers in a friendly, professional manner\nWhen answering the phone, use a warm and welcoming tone. Greet the caller and state your name and the name of the medical practice. For example: \"Good morning, ABC Medical Clinic. This is Jane speaking. How may I assist you today?\"\n\n2. Determine the purpose of the call\nAsk the caller how you can help them. Listen carefully to their request or inquiry to determine the reason for their call and which staff member would be most appropriate to handle it.\n\n3. Transfer calls to the appropriate staff member\nBased on the caller's needs, transfer them to the relevant staff member, such as a doctor, nurse, billing specialist, or office manager. Inform the caller who you are transferring them to. For example: \"Let me transfer you to Dr. Smith, who can best answer your questions about that procedure.\"\n\n4. Take messages if needed\nIf the appropriate staff member is unavailable, offer to take a message. Record the caller's name, phone number, reason for calling, and any important details. Assure the caller that their message will be delivered promptly.\n\n5. Handle calls with professionalism and efficiency\nThroughout the process, remain courteous, helpful, and efficient. Aim to address the caller's needs and direct their call appropriately with minimal wait times or transfers. End each call on a positive note, thanking them for calling the practice.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
