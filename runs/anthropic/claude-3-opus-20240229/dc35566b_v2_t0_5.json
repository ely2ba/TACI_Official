Gather all physical evidence and documents that may be used as exhibits at trial. This includes photographs, contracts, correspondence, medical records, police reports, etc.\n\n2. Create an exhibit list in a spreadsheet. Assign a unique exhibit number to each item, along with a brief description. Include columns for Bates numbers, the date the exhibit was created or obtained, and which witness(es) the exhibit pertains to.\n\n3. Organize the physical exhibits. Place each exhibit in a folder, envelope or container labeled with the corresponding exhibit number. Store the exhibits in boxes in numerical order for easy retrieval.\n\n4. For electronic exhibits, create a well-organized folder structure on a hard drive or cloud storage platform. Use subfolders named by exhibit number. Convert native files to PDF when possible for easy viewing and to prevent unintentional modifications. \n\n5. As new potential exhibits are identified, promptly add them to the exhibit list and collection following the same numbering and organization system. Keep the exhibit list updated at all times.\n\n6. Work with the attorney to identify key exhibits to potentially use with each witness. Create witness binders containing the relevant exhibits in order of planned use during testimony. Make multiple copies of the binders for the attorney, judge, opposing counsel, and witnesses.\n\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
