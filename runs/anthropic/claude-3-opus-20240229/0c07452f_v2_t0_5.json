Clearly communicate expectations: At the beginning of the school year, review the student handbook and code of conduct with your class. Explain the rules and consequences in an age-appropriate way. Post key rules in the classroom as reminders.\n2. Be consistent: Enforce the rules consistently for all students. Don't show favoritism or make exceptions. When students know what to expect, they are more likely to follow the rules.\n3. Give warnings and follow through: If a student breaks a rule, give them a warning. If the behavior continues, follow through with the stated consequence, such as loss of a privilege or a call home. Don't make empty threats.\n4. Use positive reinforcement: Acknowledge and praise students who are following the rules. Consider a classroom reward system to encourage positive behavior. Highlighting good behavior is often more effective than only punishing bad behavior.\n5. Communicate with parents: Keep parents informed about their child's behavior, both positive and negative. Work with parents as partners to address any ongoing discipline issues. Document communications and meetings.\n6. Seek support when needed: If a student repeatedly violates rules or shows more serious behavioral problems, consult with school administration, counselors, or the student support team to develop an individualized plan to help the student be more successful.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
