Here are some ways we can do this:\n\n• Invite parent volunteers to help lead or assist with hands-on learning activities, art projects, science experiments, etc. Parents can provide additional supervision and guidance to keep children engaged.\n\n• Have older students (e.g. 4th or 5th graders) act as \"reading buddies\" or tutors for younger students. Older children can read with younger students, help them practice skills, and engage them in educational games and activities.\n\n• Ask parent volunteers to share their hobbies, careers, or areas of expertise with students. Parents can give presentations, lead workshops, or assist with relevant projects to get students excited about a topic.\n\n• Organize mixed-age group activities where older and younger students work together cooperatively. Older students can help guide the younger children and be role models for focused, complex play.\n\nBy involving parents and older students in these ways, we can provide additional support and inspiration for children to engage in creative, stimulating activities. This will enrich their learning and development. Let me know if you have any other suggestions for facilitating children's complex play.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
