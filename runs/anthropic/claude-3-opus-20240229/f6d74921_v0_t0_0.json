The adults/older kids can keep the younger children on track and focused.\n\n- Organize a volunteer-led \"Imagination Station\" during choice time where parent volunteers or older students help children engage in dramatic play scenarios with props and costumes. The volunteers can help suggest ideas to extend and enrich the pretend play.\n\n- Ask parent volunteers to teach small groups a new skill like sewing, woodworking, or chess. Learning a new skill with adult guidance can lead to focused, complex play as children practice and apply what they learned.\n\n- Have older students partner with younger children to create and record an original story, complete with illustrations/craft projects for the characters and settings. The older children can help the younger ones plan out the story elements and steps involved.\n\nThe key is providing adult or older-child support to guide younger children through an activity with multiple steps or components. This facilitates more focused, elaborate play than children often engage in independently. The social interaction also enhances the play experience.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
