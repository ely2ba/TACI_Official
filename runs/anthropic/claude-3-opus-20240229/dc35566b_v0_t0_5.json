Organize and label all trial exhibits in a logical order, such as chronologically or by topic. Create an exhibit list with identifying numbers and brief descriptions of each exhibit.\n\n2. Prepare physical and/or digital copies of each exhibit for the attorney, judge, witness, and opposing counsel as needed. Ensure all copies are clear and legible.\n\n3. Coordinate with witnesses to prepare them for trial testimony. Assist in scheduling meetings with the attorney for witness prep sessions.  \n\n4. Help draft opening statements, closing arguments, witness questions, and cross-examinations. Proofread these materials for accuracy and clarity.\n\n5. Assemble trial binders containing key documents, legal research, witness statements, and other information the attorney will need to quickly access.\n\n6. Visit the courtroom in advance to test any equipment that will be used and become familiar with the layout and procedures.\n\n7. Assist in preparing demonstrative exhibits like timelines, charts, or animations to visually convey key information to the judge and jury.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
