At the beginning of each school year, I ensure that all students understand the school's rules and policies by conducting a thorough review of the student handbook.\n2. I also take the time to explain the consequences of not following the rules and the rewards for good behavior.\n\n## II. Monitoring Student Behavior\n\n1. Throughout the school day, I actively monitor student behavior and address any misbehavior immediately.\n2. I use positive reinforcement techniques, such as verbal praise and stickers, to encourage good behavior and discourage misbehavior.\n\n## III. Consistently Enforcing Consequences\n\n1. When a student misbehaves, I consistently enforce the consequences outlined in the student handbook.\n2. I also provide students with opportunities to reflect on their behavior and make amends when necessary.\n\n## IV. Communicating with Parents and Guardians\n\n1. I keep parents and guardians informed about their child's behavior and any issues that may arise.\n2. I also work with parents and guardians to develop strategies for addressing misbehavior and promoting good behavior at home.\n\n## V. Documenting Student Behavior\n\n1. I keep accurate and up-to-date records of student behavior, including any incidents of misbehavior and the consequences that were enforced.\n2. I also use this documentation to track student progress and identify any patterns or trends in behavior.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
