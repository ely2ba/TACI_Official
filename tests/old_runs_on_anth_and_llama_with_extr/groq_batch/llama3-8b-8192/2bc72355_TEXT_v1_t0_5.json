For lectures, I will ensure to maintain eye contact, vary tone and pitch, and use visual aids to keep students engaged. For discussions, I will encourage active listening, ask open-ended questions, and provide opportunities for students to share their thoughts and opinions. For demonstrations, I will break down complex concepts into smaller, manageable steps, and provide hands-on practice to reinforce understanding. Additionally, I will provide individualized support to students who require extra help, and offer extensions for those who need a challenge. By using these teaching methods, I aim to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment that fosters student engagement, motivation, and academic success.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
