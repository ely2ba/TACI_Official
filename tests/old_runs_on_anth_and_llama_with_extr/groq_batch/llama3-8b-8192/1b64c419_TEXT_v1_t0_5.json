Upon answering the call, I would greet the caller with a friendly and professional tone, introducing myself and the medical office. I would then ask the caller to state their name and the purpose of their call, and promptly direct them to the appropriate staff member or department. For example, if the caller is requesting a medication refill, I would direct them to our pharmacy department. If the caller has a medical concern or question, I would direct them to our healthcare provider. I would also take detailed messages and notes, and ensure that all calls are documented accurately and in a timely manner. Additionally, I would handle any incoming calls during peak hours or emergencies with a calm and professional demeanor, prioritizing the caller's needs and ensuring that their concerns are addressed promptly and efficiently.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
