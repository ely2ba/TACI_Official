I will then ask the caller to state their purpose for calling, and direct the call to the appropriate staff member or department. For example: \"Good morning, [Medical Practice Name], this is [Your Name]. How can I assist you today? Please state your name and the reason for your call.\" If the caller is seeking an appointment, I will ask for their availability and schedule the appointment accordingly. If the caller has a question or concern, I will take a message and forward it to the appropriate staff member. I will also ensure that all calls are handled in a timely and efficient manner, and that all necessary information is documented accurately and confidentially.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
