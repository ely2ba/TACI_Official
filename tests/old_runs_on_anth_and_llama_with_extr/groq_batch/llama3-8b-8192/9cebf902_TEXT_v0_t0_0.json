I would then conduct a thorough search of these sources using legal research databases, such as Westlaw or LexisNexis, and online legal research platforms, such as Google Scholar or Justia. I would also review relevant legal codes and documents, such as treaties, contracts, and regulations. Once I have gathered the necessary data, I would analyze it by identifying key points, summarizing the information, and highlighting any relevant legal principles or concepts. I would also consider the context in which the data was created and the potential implications of the information for the legal issue at hand.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
