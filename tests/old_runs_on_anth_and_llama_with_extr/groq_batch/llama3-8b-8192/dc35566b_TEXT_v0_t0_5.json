This would ensure that all relevant materials are easily accessible and easily identified by the court, attorneys, and jury. I would also check the exhibits against the pleadings, discovery, and other trial materials to ensure that they are accurate and relevant to the case. Additionally, I would prepare an exhibit list, which would include a detailed description of each exhibit, its relevance to the case, and the witness who will be presenting it. This would help the attorneys and court staff quickly locate and identify the exhibits during the trial.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
