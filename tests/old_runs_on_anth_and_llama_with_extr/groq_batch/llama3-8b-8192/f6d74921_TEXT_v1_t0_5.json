This can be achieved by designing activities that cater to the diverse skill levels and interests of the participants. For example, parent volunteers can assist in setting up learning centers or leading small group activities, while older students can serve as role models and mentors to their younger peers. This approach not only enhances the learning experience but also fosters a sense of community and social responsibility among the participants. Additionally, it provides an opportunity for children to develop important life skills such as communication, problem-solving, and teamwork. By involving parent volunteers and older students in children's activities, we can create a more engaging and inclusive learning environment that promotes academic achievement and personal growth.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
