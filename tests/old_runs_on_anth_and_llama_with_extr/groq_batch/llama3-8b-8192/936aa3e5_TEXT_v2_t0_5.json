Let's say the total amount is $1,000 and the principal is $800.\n\n1. Amount due = Total amount - Principal\n= $1,000 - $800\n= $200\n\n<h2>Interest Charges</h2>\nTo calculate the interest charge, we need to multiply the principal by the interest rate and the number of years. Let's say the principal is $1,000, the interest rate is 5%, and the number of years is 2.\n\n1. Interest charge = Principal x Interest rate x Number of years\n= $1,000 x 0.05 x 2\n= $100\n\n<h2>Balance</h2>\nTo calculate the balance, we need to add the principal and the interest charge. Let's say the principal is $1,000 and the interest charge is $100.\n\n1. Balance = Principal + Interest charge\n= $1,000 + $100\n= $1,100\n\n<h2>Discounts</h2>\nTo calculate the discount, we need to subtract the discount amount from the principal. Let's say the principal is $1,000 and the discount amount is $50.\n\n1. Discount = Principal - Discount amount\n= $1,000 - $50\n= $950\n\n<h2>Equity</h2>\nTo calculate the equity, we need to subtract the principal and the interest charge from the total amount. Let's say the total amount is $1,000, the principal is $800, and the interest charge is $100.\n\n1. Equity = Total amount - Principal - Interest charge\n= $1,000 - $800 - $100\n= $100\n\n<h2>Principal</h2>\nTo calculate the principal, we need to subtract the interest charge from the total amount. Let's say the total amount is $1,000 and the interest charge is $100.\n\n1. Principal = Total amount - Interest charge\n= $1,000 - $100\n= $900\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
