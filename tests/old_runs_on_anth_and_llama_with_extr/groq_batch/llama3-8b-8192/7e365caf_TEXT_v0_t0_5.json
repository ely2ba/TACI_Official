This outline should be tailored to the specific needs and goals of the training program, and should include clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points to help organize the content. Additionally, I would suggest including visual aids such as diagrams, flowcharts, and screenshots to help illustrate complex concepts and make the material more engaging and easy to understand.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
