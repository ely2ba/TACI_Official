If a company borrows $1,000 at a 5% interest rate for 1 year, the interest charge would be $50. If a company has a beginning balance of $1,000, adds $500, and subtracts $200, the new balance would be $1,300. If a company offers a 10% discount on a $100 purchase, the discounted amount would be $90. If a company has total assets of $100,000 and total liabilities of $50,000, the equity would be $50,000. If a company borrows $1,000 and pays back $500 in interest, the principal would be $500.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>"
