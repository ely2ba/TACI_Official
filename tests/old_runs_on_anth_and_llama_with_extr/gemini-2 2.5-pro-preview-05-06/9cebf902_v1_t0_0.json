Law Firm\n**DATE:** October 26, 2023\n**RE:** Overview of Research Findings: Employee Overtime Obligations under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\nThis memorandum summarizes the legal research conducted at the request of Ms. Eleanor Vance, Esq., on your behalf, concerning the general requirements for overtime pay for non-exempt employees under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The purpose of this memo is to provide you with an overview of the relevant statutes, regulations, and illustrative case law that inform these obligations.\n\n**II. SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS**\nOur research indicates that the FLSA generally requires employers to pay non-exempt employees overtime compensation at a rate of one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 in a single workweek. However, specific categories of employees may be exempt from these overtime requirements if they meet stringent criteria related to their job duties and salary, as defined by the FLSA and accompanying Department of Labor regulations.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS OF RESEARCH DATA**\n\n    **A. Statutory Framework: The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)**\n        *   The foundational federal law governing wage and hour issues, including overtime, is the Fair Labor Standards Act, codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq.\n        *   The core overtime provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1), states: \"...no employer shall employ any of his employees ... for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.\"\n        *   This statute establishes the 40-hour threshold for overtime and the minimum overtime pay rate.\n\n    **B. Regulatory Guidance: U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) Regulations**\n        *   The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) issues detailed regulations that interpret and implement the FLSA. These are located in Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.).\n        *   For example, 29 C.F.R. Part 778 provides comprehensive guidance on calculating overtime pay, defining what constitutes a \"workweek,\" and determining an employee's \"regular rate\" of pay, which is the basis for overtime calculations.\n        *   Significantly, 29 C.F.R. Part 541 details the requirements for the \"white-collar\" exemptions (executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and certain computer employees) from both minimum wage and overtime pay. To qualify for one of these exemptions, an employee must generally satisfy specific tests regarding their primary job duties and be paid on a salary basis at not less than a minimum specified amount.\n\n    **C. Illustrative Case Law (Decisions)**\n        *   Federal courts continuously interpret the FLSA and DOL regulations, and these judicial decisions (case law) provide critical guidance on how the law is applied to specific factual situations.\n        *   For instance, in *Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U.S. 680 (1946)*, the Supreme Court addressed situations where employer records are inadequate, establishing principles for employees to prove hours worked. While an older case, its principles on employer record-keeping duties and burden of proof remain influential.\n        *   More recently, cases such as *Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 584 U.S. ___ (2018)*, demonstrate how courts scrutinize the scope of FLSA exemptions, emphasizing that exemptions are to be narrowly construed. In this particular case, the Supreme Court addressed the applicability of an overtime exemption for service advisors at car dealerships.\n        *   Decisions like *Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association, 575 U.S. 92 (2015)*, have clarified the legal status and effect of DOL administrative interpretations, impacting how much deference courts give to agency guidance.\n        *   (Note: In a comprehensive legal analysis for litigation or specific advice, a broader range of more fact-specific cases would be cited and analyzed in greater detail.)\n\n    **D. Other Relevant Documents and Legal Articles**\n        *   In addition to primary sources like statutes and case law, our research process often includes a review of DOL Opinion Letters (which provide guidance on specific factual scenarios, though their precedential value has varied over time) and authoritative legal articles or treatises (such as those published by the American Bar Association or specialized employment law publications). These secondary sources can offer valuable insights into trends, common pitfalls, and interpretations of complex issues under the FLSA.\n\n**IV. IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSIDERATION**\nThe body of research on FLSA overtime requirements highlights several critical considerations for employers:\n    1.  **Accurate Employee Classification:** It is paramount to correctly classify employees as either \"exempt\" or \"non-exempt.\" This determination must be based on a factual analysis of the employee's actual job duties and compensation structure, not merely on job titles or employee preference.\n    2.  **Diligent Record-Keeping:** Employers are required to keep accurate records of all hours worked by non-exempt employees for each workday and workweek.\n    3.
