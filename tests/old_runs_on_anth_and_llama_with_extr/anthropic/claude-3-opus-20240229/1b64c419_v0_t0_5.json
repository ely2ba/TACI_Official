Answer the phone promptly, within 2-3 rings if possible. Use a friendly, professional greeting such as \"Good morning, Dr. Smith's office. This is Jane speaking, how may I assist you?\"\n\n2. Listen carefully to the caller's request or inquiry. Ask clarifying questions if needed to fully understand the reason for their call. \n\n3. If the call is for a staff member, place the caller on a brief hold and attempt to transfer the call to that person's extension. If they are unavailable, offer to take a message or send the call to their voicemail.\n\n4. For general inquiries, answer the caller's questions if you are able, or transfer them to the appropriate staff member who can best assist them. Be familiar with each staff member's roles and expertise.\n\n5. If the call is regarding a medical emergency, calmly collect the caller's information and immediately alert the appropriate provider or dial 911 if warranted.
