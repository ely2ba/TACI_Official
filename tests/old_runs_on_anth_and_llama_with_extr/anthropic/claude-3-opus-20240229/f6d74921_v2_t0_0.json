Recruit parent volunteers to assist with classroom activities and play sessions. Ask them to help guide and encourage children in focused, imaginative play with props, costumes, building materials, etc.\n2. Pair older students (e.g. 4th or 5th graders) with younger children as \"play mentors\". Have the older students demonstrate how to engage in complex pretend scenarios, build elaborate structures, or explore materials in creative ways. The younger children can learn from and imitate the older students' play.\n3. During activity time, assign parent volunteers or older students to each group of children. Ask the adults and older students to help keep the children on-task, offer ideas to extend the play, and model good social skills like cooperation and problem-solving.\n4. Plan specific imaginative play themes that parent volunteers or older students can help bring to life, such as playing restaurant, hospital, construction site, etc. Provide props and materials to support the pretend scenario and have the adults/older students guide the play.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
