Use a variety of teaching methods to engage students and accommodate different learning styles:\n• Lectures to present information and concepts\n• Class discussions to explore ideas and check for understanding \n• Demonstrations and modeling to show processes and skills\n• Hands-on activities and experiments for active learning\n• Cooperative learning groups for peer interaction and teamwork\n\n2. When instructing individual students:\n• Assess the student's prior knowledge and skill level\n• Provide one-on-one guidance and support as needed  \n• Use scaffolding techniques to break down tasks\n• Give specific, constructive feedback \n• Allow student choice and autonomy when appropriate\n\n3. When instructing groups of students:\n• Establish clear expectations and group roles\n• Foster a collaborative, inclusive environment \n• Facilitate student-led discussions\n• Provide opportunities for group projects and presentations\n• Monitor group dynamics and intervene if necessary to keep students on track\n\n4.
