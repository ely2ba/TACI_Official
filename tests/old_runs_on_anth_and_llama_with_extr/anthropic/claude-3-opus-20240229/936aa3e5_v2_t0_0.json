Amounts Due\nTo calculate an amount due, add up all relevant charges, fees, and taxes, then subtract any credits, discounts or payments already made. The remaining balance is the amount due.\n\n2. Interest Charges \nInterest is calculated by multiplying the principal balance by the interest rate for a given time period. For example, if the principal is $1,000 at 5% annual interest, the interest charge for one year would be: $1,000 x 0.05 = $50.\n\n3. Account Balances\nAn account balance is calculated by taking the previous balance, adding any new charges or deposits, and subtracting any payments, withdrawals, or fees. The result is the current account balance.\n\n4. Discounts\nA discount amount is calculated by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage. For example, a $100 item at a 20% discount would have a discount amount of $100 x 0.20 = $20. The discounted price is the original price minus the discount amount.\n\n5. Equity\nEquity is the difference between the value of an asset and any liabilities against that asset. It represents ownership. For example, if a $200,000 home has a $150,000 mortgage balance, the equity in the home is $200,000 - $150,000 = $50,000.\n\n6. Principal\nPrincipal refers to the original amount of a loan or the remaining loan balance on which interest is calculated. Principal decreases as payments are made. For example, if a $10,000 loan is taken out and $4,000 has been repaid, the remaining principal balance is $6,000.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
