Having additional adult and student leaders will allow us to:\n• Break the children into smaller groups based on interests and skill levels\n• Introduce more challenging games, projects, and activities that build key academic and social skills\n• Provide more individualized attention and guidance to keep children engaged\n• Model good social interactions and facilitate positive peer relationships\n\nWe are looking for parent volunteers to assist in the classroom for 1-2 hours per week. The older student leaders will be chosen by teachers based on maturity and responsibility. They will spend 1 hour per week (during lunch/recess time) leading activities with a small group of younger students, under the supervision of a teacher or parent volunteer.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for educational games and activities well-suited for this format, or if you know of parents interested in volunteering, please let me know. We will be holding a training next month for all parent and student leaders participating in this new program. \n\nThank you for your support and cooperation as we work to enrich our students' learning experience.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
