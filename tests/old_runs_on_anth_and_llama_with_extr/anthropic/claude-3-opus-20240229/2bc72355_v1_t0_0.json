Please listen attentively and take notes during lectures.\n\n• Discussions: We will have open dialogues as a class and in small groups to explore ideas, share perspectives, and deepen your understanding of the material. Your thoughtful participation in discussions is strongly encouraged.\n\n• Demonstrations: I will model skills, procedures, and problem-solving strategies for you to observe and learn from. Pay close attention during demonstrations so you can then practice and apply the techniques yourself.\n\nThese diverse teaching methods are designed to support different learning styles, stimulate your curiosity, and help you master the curriculum. If you have any questions about the instructional approaches, please don't hesitate to ask.\n\nI look forward to our lessons together and to supporting your growth and success as learners!\n\nSincerely,\n[Teacher Name]\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
