Amounts Due\nTo calculate an amount due, add up all relevant charges, fees, and taxes, then subtract any credits, discounts or payments already made. The remaining balance is the amount currently due.\n\n2. Interest Charges \nInterest is calculated by multiplying the principal balance by the interest rate for a given time period. For example, if the principal is $1,000 at 12% annual interest, the monthly interest charge would be:\n$1,000 x (12% / 12 months) = $10 per month\n\n3. Balances\nAn account balance is determined by taking the opening balance, adding any deposits, credits or interest earned, and subtracting any withdrawals, payments, fees or interest charges. The final amount is the current balance.\n\n4. Discounts\nA discount amount is calculated by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage. For example, a $100 item at a 20% discount would have a discount amount of:  \n$100 x 20% = $20\nThe discounted price is the original price minus the discount amount.\n\n5. Equity\nEquity is the difference between the current market value of an asset and the amount still owed on it (the remaining loan or liability balance). It represents ownership stake. As the loan is paid down or the asset appreciates in value, the equity increases.\n\n6. Principal\nPrincipal refers to the original amount borrowed in a loan, separate from interest charges. In a mortgage, for example, each monthly payment is split between interest and principal. Early in the loan term, a larger portion goes to interest. Over time, more of each payment goes toward paying down the principal balance.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
