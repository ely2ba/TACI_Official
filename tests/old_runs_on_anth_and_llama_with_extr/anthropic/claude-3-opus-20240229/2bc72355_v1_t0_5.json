Here are some key methods to incorporate when working with students individually and in groups:\n\nLectures: Prepare short lectures to introduce new topics or explain complex concepts. Keep lectures concise and use simple language appropriate for the grade level. Pause frequently to ask questions and check for understanding.\n\nDiscussions: Facilitate whole-class and small-group discussions to explore ideas, share opinions, and deepen comprehension of the material. Pose open-ended questions, call on students equitably, and create a safe environment for all students to participate.\n\nDemonstrations: Model step-by-step instructions, problem-solving approaches, or procedures. Use visual aids, manipulatives, and examples to illustrate key points. Have students follow along and then provide opportunities for guided and independent practice.\n\nVary your instructional methods and use a mix of individual, small-group, and whole-class activities to keep students engaged and meet diverse learning needs. Monitor student progress and adjust your teaching as needed to ensure all students are mastering the material.\n</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
