Then, I would contact the establishment representative, clearly explaining the problem and providing all necessary documentation. I would work collaboratively with them to identify the root cause and discuss possible solutions, such as replacement, refund, or corrective actions to prevent future occurrences. Throughout the process, I would maintain clear and professional communication to ensure a satisfactory resolution for both parties.</OUTPUT_TEXT>",
